1
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:42,239
-When I was a kid,

2
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,675
-Whenever I'd feel small
or lonely,

3
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:48,078
-I'd look up at the stars.

4
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,515
Wondered if there was life
up there.

5
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:53,917
Turns out I was looking
in the wrong direction.

6
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,954
When alien life
entered our world

7
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,790
It was from deep beneath
the pacific ocean.

8
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,627
A fissure between
two tectonic plates.

9
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,631
A portal between dimensions.

10
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,267
The breach.

11
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,469
I was fifteen
when the first Kaiju

12
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:14,638
Made land in san Francisco.

13
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,301
By the time tanks, jets
and missiles took it down

14
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:50,307
Six days and 35 miles later,
three cities were destroyed.

15
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:53,644
Tens of thousands
of lives were lost.

16
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:01,919
We mourned our dead,
memorialized the attack,

17
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,287
And moved on.

18
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,261
And then, only six months later,

19
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:14,665
The second attack hit manila.

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,633
The acid
factor of the Kaiju blood

21
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:19,036
Creates a toxic phenomenon
named Kaiju blue.

22
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,371
And then the third one hit Cabo.

23
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:23,941
And then the fourth.

24
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,477
And then we learned
this was not gonna stop.

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,646
This was just the beginning.

26
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,883
We needed a new weapon.

27
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:36,119
The world came together,
pooling its resources

28
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,522
And throwing aside old rivalries

29
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:41,525
For the sake
of the greater good.

30
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:46,530
To fight monsters,
we created monsters of our own.

31
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:50,868
The Jaeger program was born.

32
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,303
There were setbacks at first.

33
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,339
The neural load to interface
with a Jaeger

34
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,243
Proved too much
for a single pilot.

35
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,478
A twoPilot system
was implemented.

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,549
LeftHemisphere,
rightHemisphere pilot control.

37
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,384
We started winning.

38
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:10,721
Jaegers stopping Kaijus
everywhere.

39
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,157
But the jaegers were only
as good as their pilots.

40
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,694
So Jaeger pilots
turned into rock stars.

41
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:21,164
Danger turned into propaganda.

42
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,933
Kaijus into toys.

43
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:28,071
We got really good at it.

44
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,373
Winning.

45
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,379
Then..

46
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,714
then it all changed.

47
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,619
Gipsy danger,
report to bay 08, level a42.

48
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:46,623
Kaiju. Code name: Knifehead.
Category 3.

49
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,892
Yo, Yancy, wake up!
Movement in the breach.

50
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:52,095
Hey, come on!
We're being deployed.

51
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:54,932
Great. Good morning.

52
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,366
Mornin'.

53
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,970
Kaiju's a category 3..
Biggest one yet.

54
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,205
Code name: Knifehead.

55
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:03,607
What time is it?

56
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,242
2:00. Man: Go, go, go!
Move it!

57
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:08,645
A.M.?
Yep.

58
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,080
What do you say?

59
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,448
Fifth notch on the belt?

60
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:16,753
Come on, beckets.
Time for the drop.

61
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,423
Hey, kid.
Yeah?

62
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,426
Don't get cocky.

63
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,328
Years before,

64
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,065
You wouldn't have picked my
brother Yancy and I for heroes.

65
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,099
No chance.

66
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,467
Good morning, sir.

67
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:32,669
All right, let's suit up
and kick some ass!

68
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:35,806
We were never star athletes.

69
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,241
Never at the head of the class.

70
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:41,345
But we could hold our own
in a fight.

71
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,181
And it turned out
we had a unique skill:

72
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,016
We were drift compatible.

73
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,598
All right.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,002
Data on helmet.

75
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,573
Data relay gel dispersing
in circuitry suit.

76
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,301
Good morning, Becket boys!

77
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,704
Tendo, what's happening,
my man?

78
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,340
How'd that date with Alison
go last night, Mr. Choi?

79
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,575
Oh, she loved me.
Her boyfriend? Not so much.

80
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,677
You're gonna get
your ass kicked.

81
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,313
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do, brother.

82
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,681
Engage drop, Mr. Choi.

83
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,483
Engaging drop, sir.

84
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,853
Marshal Pentecost on deck.

85
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:00,190
Securing the Conn pod.
Gettin' ready to drop.

86
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,494
Conn pod door lock secure.

87
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,598
Release for drop.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,735
Gipsy danger ready
for the big drop.

89
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,737
Here we go.
Yeah!

90
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,339
Here we go!

91
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,249
Coupling confirmed, sir.

92
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,885
Engage pilotToPilot
protocol.

93
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,887
Engaging now.

94
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,289
PilotToPilot
connection protocol sequence.

95
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:54,811
Gipsy launch, bay 6.

96
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,461
Gipsy danger ready
and aligned, sir.

97
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:12,896
Rangers, this is
marshal stacker Pentecost.

98
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,231
Prepare for neural handshake.

99
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,665
Starting in 15 seconds.

100
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:20,070
14..13..

101
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,905
12, 11, 10..

102
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,641
Ready to step
into my head, kid?

103
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,078
..9, 8, 7, 6.. please, after you.
Age before beauty, old man.

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,480
PilotToPilot connection
protocol sequence..5, 4, 3..

105
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:34,451
Neural handshake initiated.
..2, 1.

106
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:38,088
The drift.
Jaeger tech.

107
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,292
Based on Darpa jet fighter
neural systems.

108
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:45,128
Two pilots,
mindMelding through memories

109
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,430
With the body
of a giant machine.

110
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,833
The deeper the bond..

111
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:52,369
the better you fight.

112
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,806
Neural handshake
strong and holding.

113
00:07:56,808 --> 00:08:00,310
Right hemisphere
is calibrating.

114
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,679
Left hemisphere calibrating.

115
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:08,251
Proofed and transmitting.

116
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:18,395
Gentlemen, your orders are

117
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,829
To hold the miracle mile
off anchorage. Copy?

118
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,398
Copy that, sir.

119
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,334
Sir, there's still a civilian
vessel in the gulf..

120
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,369
Gentlemen, you're protecting
a city of 2 million people.

121
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,405
You will not risk those lives
for a boat that holds 10.

122
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,573
Am I clear?

123
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,975
Yes, sir.
Man, that's cold.

124
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:35,579
You know what I'm thinking.

125
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,047
I'm in your brain.

126
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,682
I know.
Then let's go fishing.

127
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,317
Here we go!

128
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,986
Come on, bro!
Put some muscle to it!

129
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:46,056
Worry about yourself, kiddo!

130
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,102
There are things
you can't fight, acts of god.

131
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,539
You see a hurricane coming,
you have to get out of the way.

132
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,741
But when you're in a Jaeger,

133
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,944
Suddenly, you can fight
the hurricane.

134
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,613
You can win.

135
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:17,220
Get 'em tied down
and go down below!

136
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,688
Now!

137
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:23,026
How far to the mainland?

138
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,861
7 miles off anchorage, sir.

139
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,863
But we won't even make it past
the shallows!

140
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:28,265
No, we won't!

141
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,899
What about that island
3 miles east?

142
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,303
No! No!
It's 2 miles, sir.

143
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,572
OOne mile, sir!

144
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,207
It's getting closer.

145
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:40,610
How the hell
can it be getting closer?

146
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,851
Kaiju.

147
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:55,925
Harder starboard!

148
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,661
I'm doing it as fast as I can!

149
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,230
Now!

150
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:20,784
Oh, god!

151
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,185
What the hell?

152
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,272
Hang on!

153
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,673
Ship secure.

154
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,608
Adjust the torque!
I'm on it.

155
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,912
Torque locked.

156
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,486
Get him. Come on.
Shoot him.

157
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,221
I'm on it!
I'm on it!

158
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,866
Discharge reading, sir.

159
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,067
Plasma cannon
in the shallow shelves

160
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:45,702
7 miles off the coastal line.

161
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,936
Gipsy,
what the hell is going on?

162
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:49,239
Job's done, sir.
Lit it up twice.

163
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,740
Bagged our fifth kill.

164
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,877
You disobeyed a direct order!

165
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,879
Respectfully, sir,

166
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,113
We intercepted a Kaiju and
saved everyone on that boat.

167
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,015
Get back to your post, now!

168
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,419
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,422
Kaiju signature rising!

170
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,856
Sensor checks.

171
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:09,859
That thing's still alive, sir.
Gipsy!

172
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:12,195
We're still getting
a signature!

173
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,064
That Kaiju is still alive!

174
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,767
Grab the boat
and get out of there.

175
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,369
You copy?

176
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,772
Grab the boat
and get out of there now!

177
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,616
Take it, Raleigh!
I got this!

178
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,960
Loccent, we're hit!

179
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,800
Left arm's gone cold, sir.

180
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:11,321
The hull!
It went through the hull!

181
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,090
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need..

182
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,196
No! No!

183
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,231
Loading.

184
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:14,851
Second discharge fried
all the comms, sir.

185
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,985
I'm not getting any signals.

186
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:18,388
Pressure dropping!

187
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,390
 No pressure!
 No pressure!

188
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,292
No signatures, sir.

189
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,796
What do we do now, sir?

190
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:33,603
Now, I want you to keep
your eye on that gauge there.

191
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,439
Now, you know
what I'd like to find?

192
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:37,874
I'd like to find a whole ship.

193
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,509
That's what I'd like to find.

194
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,910
Wait, wait!

195
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,345
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

196
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:43,746
Wait!
Right there, right there!

197
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:44,948
Dig!

198
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,951
Hey, what is it?

199
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,787
It's just an old toy.

200
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,457
We never find anything good.

201
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,460
Listen.

202
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,530
Jeez!

203
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,470
Oh, my god.

204
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:31,861
Stay here!

205
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,717
Mister?

206
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,022
Can I help?

207
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:06,663
Yancy.

208
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:19,142
Run!
Get help, fast!

209
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,611
It's gonna be all right.

210
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:09,759
The Kaiju are learning
our defenses.

211
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,995
They're adapting.
Evolving.

212
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:15,898
And we're losing jaegers faster
than we can build them.

213
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,934
Lima.

214
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,869
Seattle.

215
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,271
Vladivostok.

216
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:25,508
Category 4 Kaijus are now
coming through the breach.

217
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,510
I think even you can see,
marshal,

218
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,912
This is no longer
a sound strategy.

219
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,215
The frequency of the attacks
has increased.

220
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,450
The jaegers are not
the most viable

221
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:35,918
Line of defense anymore.

222
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,754
I am aware.

223
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:42,191
Those are my rangers that die
every time a Jaeger falls,

224
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,960
Which is why I'm asking you
for one last chance..

225
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,962
Excuse me, marshal.
Excuse me!

226
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,931
..one final assault with
everything we've got. Listen to me.

227
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,933
The Jaeger program
is dead, marshal.

228
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,935
On the other hand,

229
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,937
The coastal wall program
is a promising option.

230
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:56,439
The world appreciates

231
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,241
All that you and your men
have done,

232
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,409
But it's over.
We will authorize you

233
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,044
To take all remaining jaegers

234
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,313
Hong Kong.

235
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:08,117
We're prepared to fund you
for the next eight months

236
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,886
While the coastal wall
is completed.

237
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,088
After that, you will receive
no further support.

238
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,424
You have your answer, marshal.

239
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:18,294
So that's it?

240
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:21,998
It's over?

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,067
Suits and ties, flashy smiles.

242
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,402
That's all they are, stacker.

243
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,875
We don't need 'em.

244
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,865
Ration cards, guys!

245
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,600
Come on, come on!

246
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,602
Let's go!

247
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:02,805
Now, I got good news
and I got bad news, fellas.

248
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,640
Which one you wanna hear first?

249
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:05,842
Bad news!

250
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,947
Three guys died yesterday
working the top of the wall.

251
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,851
What's the good news?

252
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,887
The good news is,
I got three new job openings.

253
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,189
Top of the wall.

254
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,859
Okay, who wants to work?
Who wants to eat?

255
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,361
Come on!

256
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,771
I am here in Sydney,
where earlier today,

257
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,674
Yet another Kaiju attack
took place.

258
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:14,443
The Kaiju,
an enormous category 4,

259
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:18,447
Broke through the coastal wall
in less than an hour.

260
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,919
The wall of life
had been deemed unbreachable

261
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,553
By its builders.

262
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,756
Why the hell are we even
buildin' this thing?

263
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,424
The creature entered the city
through Sydney cove.

264
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:30,426
That.. That thing

265
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,628
Went through the wall like it was nothing.
Ironically, it was

266
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,064
The recently decommissioned
Jaeger, striker eureka,

267
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,565
Piloted by Herc
and chuck Hansen,

268
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,835
That finally took
the beast down.

269
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,160
Look, they decommissioned

270
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,095
The Jaeger program
because of mediocre pilots.

271
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,230
It's that simple.

272
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,299
That's striker eureka's
tenth kill to date.

273
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,734
It's a new record.

274
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,769
And you're still
going to Hong Kong,

275
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,638
Even at a time like this?

276
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,940
Well, orders are orders.
What else am I supposed to do?

277
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,842
Come on, mate.

278
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:26,682
Chuck Hansen, one of
the pilots of striker eureka,

279
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:29,752
The Jaeger that took down
the Kaiju.

280
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,995
Mr. Becket.

281
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,831
Marshal.
Looking sharp.

282
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,833
Long time.

283
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,002
Five years, four months.

284
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,371
Can I have a word?

285
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,973
Attention,
all zone three welders.

286
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,609
Step into my office, marshal.

287
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:55,811
Took me a while to find you.

288
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,813
Anchorage, Sheldon point,
Nome..

289
00:21:57,815 --> 00:22:00,216
Yeah, a man in my position
travels with the wall,

290
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,451
Chasing shifts
to make a livin'.

291
00:22:02,453 --> 00:22:04,820
What do you want?

292
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:07,823
I've spent the last six months

293
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:11,227
Activating everything
I can get my hands on.

294
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,697
There's an old Jaeger,
a mark 3.

295
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,133
You may know it.
It needs a pilot.

296
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,235
I'm guessing I wasn't
your first choice.

297
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,871
You a my first choice.

298
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,374
All the other mark 3 pilots
are dead.

299
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,649
Look..

300
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,852
I can't have anyone else
in my head again.

301
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:40,089
I'm done.

302
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,092
I was still connected
to my brother when he died.

303
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:46,729
I can't go through that again,
man, I'm sorry.

304
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,998
Haven't you heard,
Mr. Becket?

305
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,335
The world is coming to an end.

306
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:56,739
So where would you rather die?!

307
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,942
Here, or in a Jaeger?!

308
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:11,480
Mr. Becket,
this is Mako Mori.

309
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,082
One of our brightest.

310
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,652
Also in charge of the mark 3
restoration program.

311
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:20,289
She personally handpicked
your copilot candidates.

312
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,828
Hey.

313
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:41,844
At ease.

314
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,779
We will tour the facility first

315
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:47,316
And then miss Mori will show you
to your Jaeger, Mr. Becket.

316
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,018
 Wait for us, please!
 Hold the door, please!

317
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,886
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

318
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,891
Stay back! Kaiju specimens
are extremely rare,

319
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,359
So look
but don't touch, please.

320
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,895
Mr. Becket,
this is our research team.

321
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:02,164
Dr. Gottlieb
and dr. Geiszler.

322
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,566
Oh, no, call me newt.

323
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,468
Only my mother calls me doctor.

324
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,737
Hermann, these are human beings.
Why don't you say hello?

325
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,339
I have asked you not to refer to
me by my first name around others.

326
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,208
I am a doctor with over 10 years
decorated experience..

327
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,576
Oh, no, yes.
I have ten.. 10 years of experience, man.

328
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,411
I'm very sorry.

329
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,981
Oh, please.
Who is that, Yamarashi?

330
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,884
Oh, this little Kaiju?
Yeah, you got a good eye.

331
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:25,054
My brother and I
took him down in 2017.

332
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,923
You know he was one of
the biggest category 3s ever?

333
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:29,792
He was 2,500 tons of awesome.

334
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:36,165
Or awful. You know,
whatever you wanna call it.

335
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,433
Yes, please excuse him.

336
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,168
He's a Kaiju groupie.
He loves..

337
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,769
Shut up, Hermann,
I don't love them, okay?

338
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,238
I study them.

339
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,006
And unlike most people,

340
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:47,209
I wanna see one alive
and up close one day.

341
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,578
Trust me, you don't want to.

342
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,583
So that's your
research division?

343
00:25:54,585 --> 00:25:56,552
Things have changed.

344
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:02,358
We're not an army anymore,
Mr. Becket.

345
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,393
We're the resistance.

346
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,996
Welcome to the shatterdome.

347
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,583
War clock.

348
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,785
We reset it
after every Kaiju attack.

349
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,120
Keeps everyone focused.

350
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,489
The frequency of attacks
is accelerating.

351
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,324
How long till the next reset?

352
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:37,726
A week, if we're lucky.

353
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,828
My experts believe there'll be
a Kaiju attack

354
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,765
Even before that.

355
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,100
This complex used to
lodge 30 jaegers

356
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,169
In five bays
just like this one.

357
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:50,939
Now we only have
four jaegers left.

358
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,908
I didn't know it was this bad.

359
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,243
It is that bad.

360
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,145
Crimson typhoon, china.

361
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,513
One of the greatest.

362
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,114
Assembled in Changzhou.

363
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,283
Full titanium core, no alloys.

364
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:04,653
Fifty diesel engines
per muscle strand.

365
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,188
Deadly, precise fighter.

366
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,756
She's piloted
by the wei tang brothers.

367
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:09,625
Triplets.

368
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,327
Local lads.

369
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,430
They've successfully defended
Hong Kong port seven times.

370
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:16,632
They use
the thundercloud formation.

371
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,600
Oh, yeah.
TripleArm technique.

372
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:19,735
Very effective.

373
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:26,608
That tank,
last of the t90s.

374
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,844
Cherno alpha.
First generation mark 1.

375
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:31,480
The heaviest and oldest Jaeger
in the service.

376
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,717
But make no mistake, Mr. Becket,
it's a brutal war machine.

377
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,218
And those two,

378
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,187
Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovksy.

379
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,621
Yeah, I've heard of 'em.

380
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:41,657
Perimeter patrol,
Siberian wall.

381
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,393
On thei watch it stayed
unbreached for six years.

382
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:47,463
Six years.

383
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,479
Herc! Chuck!

384
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,415
Gentlemen,
welcome to Hong Kong!

385
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,684
Wait here.

386
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,719
Max!
Come here!

387
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:12,888
Remember me?

388
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,090
Don't drool all over miss Mori.
Hi.

389
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:16,859
Sees a pretty girl
and he gets all wound up.

390
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,594
Raleigh,
this is Hercules Hansen,

391
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,262
An old friend
from the mark 1 glory days.

392
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:21,997
I know you, mate.
We rode together before.

393
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:24,366
We did, sir. Six years ago.
My brother and I.

394
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,568
It was a three Jaeger team drop.
That's right. Manila.

395
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,903
Sorry about your brother.

396
00:28:27,905 --> 00:28:29,571
Thank you, sir.

397
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:32,908
Herc and his son chuck'll
be runnin' point

398
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,243
Usin' striker eureka.

399
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,778
Fastest Jaeger in the world.

400
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,446
First and last of the mark 5s.

401
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,282
Australia decommissioned it
a day before the Sydney attack.

402
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:42,684
Yeah, it was lucky we were still around.
Yep.

403
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:43,886
Now it's runnin' point for us.

404
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,287
Wait, running point on what?

405
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,056
You haven't told me
what I'm doing here yet.

406
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,526
We're going for the breach,
Mr. Becket.

407
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,561
We're gonna strap a 2,400 pound

408
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,631
Thermonuclear warhead
to striker's back.

409
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,767
Detonate an equivalent of
1.2 million tons of TNT,

410
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,537
And you and two other Jaegers'll
be runnin' defense for them.

411
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,105
Thought we were the resistance.

412
00:29:03,107 --> 00:29:05,040
Where'd you get something
that big?

413
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,209
See the Russians back there?

414
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:08,944
They can get us anything.

415
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:09,945
Herc, shall we?

416
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:11,313
Good to have you back.

417
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:12,548
Thank you, sir.

418
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,483
I'll show you
to your Jaeger now.

419
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,119
Miss Mori,
will you give me a minute?

420
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:19,655
Marshal!

421
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,957
Sir, we've hit
the breach before.

422
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,326
It doesn't work.
Nothing goes through.

423
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:25,627
What's changed?

424
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,230
I've got a plan.
I need you ready.

425
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:29,565
That's all.

426
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,600
Let's go, Herc!

427
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:33,569
Max, come here!

428
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:38,574
Crew 17, please report
to the fifth floor.

429
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:41,677
Zero minus two.

430
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,612
Xy minus two.

431
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:44,980
REQ.

432
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:46,281
In the beginning,

433
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:47,850
The Kaiju attacks
were spaced by 24 weeks.

434
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,853
Then twelve, then six,
then every two weeks.

435
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,122
The last one in Sydney
was a week.

436
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:57,659
In four days, we could be seeing
a Kaiju every eight hours

437
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:00,329
Until they are coming
every four minutes.

438
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,965
Marshal, we should witness
a double event

439
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,366
Within seven days.

440
00:30:04,368 --> 00:30:05,834
Mr. Gottlieb,

441
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,936
I'm to drop a 2,400 pound
thermonuclear bomb.

442
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:09,838
I need more than a prediction.

443
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,507
Well, uh,
that's a problem, then

444
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,208
Because see, he actually

445
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,377
Can't give you anything more
than a prediction.

446
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,513
No Kaiju entrails over my side
of the room.

447
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,814
You know the rules.

448
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:21,016
Every bloody day.
It's incessant.

449
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:22,851
Gents! On point.

450
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,319
Numbers do not lie.

451
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:27,122
Politics and poetry,
promises, these are lies.

452
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:30,692
Numbers are as close as we get
to the handwriting of god.

453
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:32,027
What?

454
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,729
Would you give me a moment?

455
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,330
There will be a double event

456
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,332
And then,
shortly thereafter, three.

457
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,567
And then four.

458
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,202
And then we're dead.

459
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:42,004
I get it.
Alas.

460
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,207
This is where
the good news comes.

461
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:49,811
Here is our universe,

462
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:52,681
And here is theirs.

463
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:54,750
And this is what we call
"the throat,"

464
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,852
The passage between
the breach and us.

465
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,754
We know that it's atomic
in nature.

466
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,756
I predict that
the increased traffic

467
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,258
Will force the breach
to stabilize

468
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,093
And remain open long enough

469
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:08,330
To get the device through..

470
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,666
and collapse its structure.

471
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,734
Yeah, and that's where
I gotta chime in

472
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:15,103
Because, really,
I wouldn't wanna go in there

473
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:17,239
With that limited amount
of information.

474
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:19,374
Newton,
don't embarrass yourself.

475
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,676
That's what I was tryin' to say.
Just hear me out for a second.

476
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,244
Give me a second, please.

477
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,087
Why do we judge the Kaiju
on a category system?

478
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:28,183
It's because each one is completely
different from the next, right?

479
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,085
You see what I'm saying? One looks like
a shark and one looks like a fish..

480
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:32,254
Dr. Geiszler.
Just get to the point.

481
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:34,189
Yes.
The point is I don't think

482
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:35,724
They're all completely different
after all.

483
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,593
These are some samples
I collected, all right?

484
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,796
Now, this one here
was harvested in Sydney.

485
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,398
And this was harvested
in manila.

486
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,633
6 years ago.

487
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:48,470
They have the same exact DNA.

488
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:51,707
They're clones.

489
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:55,711
And this is the point where
he goes completely crazy.

490
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,914
There's so much more to
the Kaiju than we understand.

491
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,650
And we've really only
scratched the surface.

492
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,952
This is a piece
of a Kaiju's brain.

493
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:06,121
Now, unfortunately,
it's damaged.

494
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:08,924
It's a little bit weak.
But it's still alive.

495
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,492
Now, I think I can tap into it

496
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:12,127
Using the same technology

497
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:14,429
That allows the two Jaeger
pilots to share a neural bridge.

498
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:16,164
Now, think about that.

499
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,300
I could tell you exactly

500
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,068
How to get through
the breach yourselves.

501
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,671
You're suggesting that we
initiate a drift with a Kaiju?

502
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,840
No, no. No, no. Not like
a whole Kaiju, you know,

503
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,608
Just a tiny piece of its brain.

504
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,777
The neural surge would be
too much for the human brain.

505
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:31,246
 I agree.
 I don't agree.

506
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:34,249
Gottlieb, I'd like your data
on my desk asap.

507
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,784
Sir.

508
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:38,186
No, but his is so..
Thank you, newt.

509
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,489
Guys, now, this is
the most amazing thing..

510
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,958
Newton, I know that you're
desperate to be right

511
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,661
So you've not wasted your life
being a Kaiju groupie,

512
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,262
But it's not going to work.

513
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,797
It is going to work, Hermann.

514
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,499
And I'll tell you
something else.

515
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,600
Fortune favors the brave, dude.

516
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:52,801
You heard them.

517
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,536
They won't give you
the equipment

518
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,705
And even if they did,
you'd kill yourself.

519
00:32:56,707 --> 00:33:00,876
Well, I'd be a rock star.

520
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,447
There she is.

521
00:33:09,186 --> 00:33:11,019
Oh, my god.

522
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,955
Look at her.

523
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:19,027
Gipsy danger.

524
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,129
God, it's so beautiful.

525
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:22,564
She looks like new.

526
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:24,232
Better than new.

527
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:26,868
She has a doubleCore
nuclear reactor.

528
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,172
She's one of a kind now.

529
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,574
She always was.

530
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:35,243
How do you like
your ride, Becket boy?

531
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:36,878
Solid iron hull, no alloys.

532
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,081
Forty engine blocks
per muscle strands.

533
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,016
HyperTorque driver
for every limb

534
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:42,851
And a new fluid synapse system.

535
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,187
Come here.

536
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,388
Tendo.

537
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,390
It's good to see you, buddy.

538
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:50,559
It's good
to see you too, brother.

539
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,094
It's just like old times.

540
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,064
So what's your story?

541
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,599
Restoring old jaegers,

542
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:00,035
Showing hasBeens
like me around.

543
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:01,770
That can't be it.

544
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,739
You a pilot?

545
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,774
No. No yet.

546
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,844
But I wanna be one,
more than anything.

547
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,379
What's your simulator score?

548
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:14,683
51 drops, 51 kills.

549
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,051
Wow, that's amazing.

550
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:18,520
But you're not one of
the candidates tomorrow?

551
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:20,288
I am not.

552
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,891
The marshal has his reasons.

553
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,026
Yeah, he always does,
doesn't he?

554
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:28,196
But with 51 kills, I can't
imagine what they could be.

555
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:31,299
I hope you approve
of my choices.

556
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:35,804
I've studied your fighting
techniques and strategy.

557
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:38,206
Even.. Alaska.

558
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,276
And what do you think?

559
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:45,947
I think you're unpredictable.

560
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,049
You have a habit of deviating

561
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,252
From standard
combat techniques.

562
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,555
You take risks and injure
yourself and your crew.

563
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:57,025
I don't think you're the right
man for this mission.

564
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,663
Wow.

565
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:04,065
Thank you for your honesty.

566
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,634
You might be right.

567
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,803
But one day,
when you're a pilot,

568
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:13,041
You're gonna see that in combat
you make decisions.

569
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:18,380
And you have to live
with the consequences.

570
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:22,217
That's what I'm trying to do.

571
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,318
The candidates are ready.

572
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,687
We will commence the trials
immediately, sir.

573
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,455
Good.
But there is one thing.

574
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:02,724
We.. Mako,
we have talked about this.

575
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:05,327
We will not be talking
about it again.

576
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,795
Hm?

577
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,630
You promised me.

578
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,735
Mako.

579
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:18,173
Vengeance is like
an open wound.

580
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:21,843
You cannot take that level
of emotion into the drift.

581
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:24,813
For my family, I need..

582
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,260
Raleigh.

583
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,594
Come sit with us.

584
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:41,363
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

585
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,866
Ah, come on, there's plenty
of room at our table.

586
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,534
I haven't seen bread in awhile.

587
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,403
Hong Kong.

588
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,538
Beauty of an open port,
no rationing.

589
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,776
We've got potatoes, peas,
sweet beans, decent meat loaf.

590
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:56,444
Pass the potatoes.

591
00:36:56,446 --> 00:37:00,115
Raleigh, this is my son, chuck.
He's my copilot now.

592
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,684
He's more my copilot,
right, dad?

593
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,120
So you're the guy, eh?

594
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,955
You're the guy who's gonna run
defense for me

595
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,556
In that old rust bucket
of yours?

596
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:11,026
 That's the plan.
 Good.

597
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,461
So when was the last time
you jockeyed, ray?

598
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,865
About five years ago.

599
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,700
What have you been doin'
for five years?

600
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,435
Something pretty important,
I reckon.

601
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:22,771
I was in construction.

602
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,073
Oh, wow, that's great.

603
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,374
I mean, that's really useful.

604
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,809
Uh, you know,
we get into a fight,

605
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,544
You can build our way
out of it, eh, ray?

606
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,647
It's Raleigh.

607
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:34,316
Whatever.

608
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,285
Look, you're Pentecost's
bright idea.

609
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,387
My old man,
he seems to like you,

610
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,791
But it's guys like you who
brought down the Jaeger program.

611
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,260
To me, you're dead weight.
You slow me down,

612
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,495
I'm gonna drop you
like a sack of Kaiju shit.

613
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,800
I'll see you around, Raleigh.

614
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,068
Come, max.

615
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,104
You can blame me for that one.

616
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:57,605
I've raised him on my own.

617
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,441
He's a smart kid,
but I never knew

618
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,178
Whether to give him a hug
or a kick in the ass.

619
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,613
With respect, sir..

620
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:09,551
I'm pretty sure
which one he needs.

621
00:38:16,526 --> 00:38:18,593
4 points to zero.

622
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:30,839
4 points to 1.

623
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:48,023
4 points to 2.

624
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,891
Okay, what?

625
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:51,659
You don't like 'em?

626
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:53,895
I thought you selected
them personally.

627
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:54,996
Excuse me?

628
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,464
Every time a match ends

629
00:38:56,466 --> 00:38:58,400
You make this little gesture,

630
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,069
Like you're critical
of their performance.

631
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:04,072
It's not their performance,
it's yours.

632
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,874
Your gambit.

633
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,342
You could have taken all of them
two moves earlier.

634
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,644
You think so?

635
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:10,745
I know so.

636
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:12,680
Can we change this up?

637
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:15,383
How 'bout we give her a shot?

638
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,751
Yeah!

639
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:18,219
No.

640
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:20,488
We stick to the cadet list
we have, ranger.

641
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,657
Only candidates
with drift compatibility..

642
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:24,225
Which I have, marshal.

643
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:25,894
Mako, this is not only about
a neural connection.

644
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,530
It's also about
a physical compatibility.

645
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,231
What's the matter, marshal?

646
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:32,514
Don't think your brightest can
cut it in the ring with me?

647
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:36,805
Go.

648
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:44,345
Four strikes marks a win.

649
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:52,687
Remember,
it's about compatibility.

650
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,456
It's a dialogue, not a fight.

651
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,591
But I'm not gonna dial down
my moves.

652
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:58,226
Okay.

653
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,129
Then neither will I.

654
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:19,414
10.

655
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,318
11.

656
00:40:26,922 --> 00:40:28,957
21.
Concentrate.

657
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:38,433
22.

658
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,667
Better watch it.

659
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,515
32.

660
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,816
MoriSan.

661
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,375
Enough.

662
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,778
I've seen what I need to see.

663
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,113
Me too.

664
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,681
She's my copilot.

665
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:29,184
That's not going to work.

666
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,618
Why not?

667
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,453
Because I said so,
Mr. Becket.

668
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,322
I made my decision.

669
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:35,957
Report to the shatterdome
in two hours

670
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,625
And find out
who your copilot will be.

671
00:41:52,474 --> 00:41:55,043
Mako.

672
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,178
What was all that about?

673
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,982
I mean, I'm not crazy.
You felt it, right?

674
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:02,317
We are drift compatible.

675
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,219
Thank you for standing up
for me.

676
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,922
But there is nothing
to talk about.

677
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,295
That's my room.

678
00:42:16,265 --> 00:42:18,199
Excuse me.

679
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,335
I mean, come on. I thought
you wanted to be a pilot.

680
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,707
Mako,
this is worth fighting for.

681
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,243
We don't have to just obey him.

682
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:33,715
It's not obedience,
Mr. Becket.

683
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:37,118
It's respect.

684
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,421
Would you at least tell me
what his problem is?

685
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:03,878
In the wake
of the Sydney incident,

686
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,381
Which showed
the ineffective nature

687
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,982
Of the wall of life program,

688
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:10,918
Many are questioning
the government's motives

689
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,555
And wondering why the Jaeger
program has been discontinued.

690
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:16,791
Riots have erupted
along the coastlines

691
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:20,561
Of several pan pacific cities.

692
00:43:20,563 --> 00:43:24,098
We have now relocated
millions of civilians

693
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:27,669
And supplies 300 miles inland
to the safe zones.

694
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,637
Safe zones?
For the rich and powerful?

695
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,905
What about the rest of us?

696
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,140
Yeah, answer the question.

697
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,908
I believe the wall of life

698
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,577
Is still our best option
at this time.

699
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,413
And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter.

700
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,014
Than.. Thank you.

701
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:46,988
Kaiju/human drift experiment,
take one.

702
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,359
The, uh.. The brain segment
is the frontal lobe.

703
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:54,862
Um, chances are..

704
00:43:54,864 --> 00:43:57,432
the segment's far too damaged
to drift with.

705
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,469
Hermann, if you're
listening to this,

706
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,004
Well, I'm either alive

707
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:06,040
And I've proven
what I've just done works..

708
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,343
in which case, ha, I won.

709
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,145
Or I'm dead and I'd like you to
know that it's all your fault.

710
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:12,814
It really is, you know.

711
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,284
You drove me to this.
In which case, ha, I also won.

712
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,820
Sort of.

713
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,988
I'm going in in three..

714
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,291
two..

715
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,892
one.

716
00:44:25,627 --> 00:44:27,462
Hah!

717
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:51,252
Newton.
Newton!

718
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:53,788
What have you done?

719
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:04,432
Gipsy danger neural test

720
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,769
Commencing in 20 minutes.

721
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:20,314
Gipsy danger neural test commencing
in 20 minutes.

722
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,456
Mm.
May I come in, Mako?

723
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:34,462
All pilots report to mess hall.

724
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:37,999
A long time ago,
I made you a promise.

725
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,377
These transmitters
are nonOperative.

726
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,379
I need them replaced.

727
00:45:57,152 --> 00:45:59,387
Setting harness for test mode.

728
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,988
Waiting for second pilot.

729
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:11,432
Two pilots on board.

730
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:14,335
I'm gonna take this side
if you don't mind.

731
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:16,070
My left arm's kinda shot.

732
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:17,338
Sure.

733
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:22,009
Are you gonna say anything?

734
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,411
No point.

735
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:27,248
In five minutes you're
gonna be inside my head.

736
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,016
You look good.

737
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:34,956
Pilots on board
and ready to connect.

738
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,691
Prepare for neural handshake.

739
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,227
Initiating neural handshake.

740
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:49,270
We're not in
the simulator now, Mako.

741
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:51,873
Remember,
don't chase the rabbit.

742
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,341
Random access
brain impulse triggers.

743
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,775
Memories.

744
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:56,043
Just let 'em flow,
don't latch on.

745
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:58,012
Tune 'em out.
Stay in the drift.

746
00:46:58,014 --> 00:46:59,447
The drift is silence.

747
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,718
Neural interface drift
initiated.

748
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:15,229
Look, Raleigh!
Over there!

749
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:16,998
Mama!

750
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,368
Raleigh, listen to me!
Raleigh, listen to me!

751
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,142
Right hemisphere calibrated.

752
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,545
Left hemisphere calibrated.

753
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:35,616
Ready to activate the Jaeger.

754
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,354
Okay, gipsy.
Lining up nicely.

755
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:42,023
Better get ready.

756
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,425
Pilot to Jaeger connection
complete.

757
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:46,661
Marshal!
Marshal!

758
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,895
I need to talk to you.

759
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,363
Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.

760
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:50,698
I'm sure you can appreciate

761
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,099
How important
this moment is to me.

762
00:47:52,101 --> 00:47:54,068
Newton created a neural bridge

763
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,470
From garbage
and drifted with a Kaiju.

764
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,778
I found him prone,
and he's sort of dazed.

765
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,480
I don't exactly know
what to do.

766
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:11,719
I told you it would work.

767
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,555
Yes, you did.
Well, what'd you see?

768
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:16,857
You know, it was only
a fragment of a brain,

769
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,427
So really all I was able to get
was, like, a series

770
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,796
Of, uh, images or..
Or impressions. You know?

771
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,931
Like when you blink your eyes
over and over and over again

772
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,399
All you really see
are, like, frames.

773
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:26,601
Um, it was emotional in the..

774
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,135
Newton, Newton.
Okay, Newton.

775
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:31,372
It was so..
Newton, look at me.

776
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:36,377
Now I want you to take your time
and be very specific.

777
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:39,447
Okay.

778
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,948
Well, I don't feel like

779
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,717
They're just following some sort
of animalistic urge,

780
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,151
You know, just hunting
and gathering.

781
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:46,454
And I think they're attacking us
under orders.

782
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,822
That's impossible.

783
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,724
Is that impossible?
It's impossible.

784
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,425
Because.. You know what?
Why don't you drift with a Kaiju?!

785
00:48:51,427 --> 00:48:53,127
You! Shut up!

786
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:54,495
Yes, sir.

787
00:48:54,497 --> 00:48:57,164
You, keep talking.

788
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:03,771
These beings, these masters,
they're colonists.

789
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,339
They overtake worlds.
They just..

790
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:07,008
They just consume them
and then..

791
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,509
Then, they move on to the next.

792
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,412
And they've been here before
in sort of a trial run.

793
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:12,780
It was the dinosaurs.

794
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:15,082
But the atmosphere
wasn't conducive, right?

795
00:49:15,084 --> 00:49:17,652
So they waited it out.
And they waited it out.

796
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,587
And now, you know,
with ozone depletion,

797
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,489
And carbon monoxide,
polluted waters..

798
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,691
Well, we've practically
terraformed it for them.

799
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:25,993
'Cause now they're coming back,
and it's perfect.

800
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:27,995
See, the first wave,
that was just the hounds.

801
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,764
Categories 1 through 4,
it was nothing.

802
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,599
Their sole purpose was to aim
for the populated areas

803
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,967
And take out
the vermin.. Us!

804
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,770
The second wave,
that is the exterminators.

805
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,705
And they will finish the job.

806
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:42,143
And then, the new tenants
will take possession.

807
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,545
See, the reason that I found
the identical DNA

808
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,515
In the two separate Kaiju organs
is because they are grown!

809
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,116
Newton,
I need you to do it again.

810
00:49:49,118 --> 00:49:50,818
I need more information.

811
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,021
Wh..? I can't..
I can't do it again.

812
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,657
II mean,
not unless you have

813
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,293
A fresh Kaiju brain
lying around.

814
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,129
Do you?

815
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:10,504
Pretty impressive.

816
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:12,740
Yeah, he remembers
how to turn it on.

817
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:14,141
Oi, show some respect.

818
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,643
When his brother died,

819
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,179
He got the Jaeger back to shore
on his own.

820
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,182
I've known one other pilot's
been able to do that.

821
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,917
Now, there are
certain individuals

822
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,719
Whose business
is the preservation

823
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,487
And exploitation
of Kaiju remains.

824
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,522
Yeah, right, black market
dealers, right?

825
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:30,658
Yep. They're in and out
in a matter of hours.

826
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,360
They neutralize the acidic
factor of the blood,

827
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:35,362
And they harvest
what they need.

828
00:50:35,364 --> 00:50:37,598
Now, this guy,
this is Hannibal Chau.

829
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,533
He runs the Kaiju black market
here in Asia.

830
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:41,235
When our funding ran out,

831
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:42,903
We turned to him for help,
and in return,

832
00:50:42,905 --> 00:50:44,105
I gave him exclusive rights

833
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,439
To all Kaiju remains
in the region.

834
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:46,674
You did that?

835
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,542
Last days of war, gentlemen.

836
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:50,745
Go to the corner of fong
and tull.

837
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,347
Show them that card.
Look for that symbol.

838
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:56,117
And a word to the wise,
do not trust him.

839
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:04,058
Calibration complete.

840
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,260
The hull!
It went through the hull!

841
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:08,062
Raleigh, listen to me!
You need..

842
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:12,466
Pilot out of alignment.

843
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:13,901
Both out of alignment.

844
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:15,269
Both of them?

845
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:17,738
Both of them.
Gipsy, gipsy!

846
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,240
You're out of alignment!

847
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,442
You are both out of alignment.

848
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:21,942
I'm okay.
Just let me control it.

849
00:51:21,944 --> 00:51:23,778
Pilot two, out of alignment.

850
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,446
You're stabilizing.
But Mako is way out.

851
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:27,214
Mako.
She's starting to chase the rabbit!

852
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:29,583
Mako, don't get stuck
in a memory.

853
00:51:29,585 --> 00:51:32,419
Stay with me.
Stay in the now.

854
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,088
Don't engage in a memory.

855
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,790
Mako.

856
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,124
Mako!

857
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,726
Listen to me.

858
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,694
Mako?

859
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:05,986
Mama!

860
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:01,642
Mako.

861
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:05,045
This is just a memory.

862
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:06,914
None of this is real.

863
00:53:30,272 --> 00:53:33,107
Weapons system engaged.

864
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,910
Plasma cannon powering up.

865
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,412
Oh, no.

866
00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:52,693
Weapon system engaged!
Go to failSafe!

867
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:54,061
FailSafe not responding.

868
00:53:54,063 --> 00:53:55,863
There's a problem
with the neural blocker!

869
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,565
Her connection's
way too strong!

870
00:53:58,567 --> 00:53:59,934
Fully charged.
Mako!

871
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,869
Mako, listen to me.

872
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:06,006
This is just a memory.
None of it is real.

873
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:25,492
The power line!
The power line!

874
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:28,062
Get the main power line!

875
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:50,017
Take them offline!
Take them offline!

876
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:53,754
I just did.

877
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:04,098
Weapon system disengaged.

878
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,701
Mako!

879
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,642
Neural bridge exercise invalid.

880
00:55:18,047 --> 00:55:21,015
It's okay.
It's okay.

881
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,218
Drift sequence terminated.

882
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,389
Would you like to try again?

883
00:55:57,886 --> 00:56:00,621
Hello.

884
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:18,772
PssPsst.

885
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:22,509
You looking for
some Kaiju bone powder?

886
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:24,011
SSome bone..?

887
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,413
Some bone powder?

888
00:56:26,415 --> 00:56:28,515
Uh, no, why would I want that?

889
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:32,419
Male potency.
I take it myself.

890
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:35,422
I see.
Uh, no, thank you.

891
00:56:35,424 --> 00:56:37,925
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

892
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:41,662
Come.

893
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:46,467
Hannibal Chau, huh?

894
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,335
Good luck.

895
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,078
Oh, my god!

896
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,147
Oh, my god,
this place is heaven!

897
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:03,417
That's a lymph gland
from a category 2!

898
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,785
And what are you
working on here?

899
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:07,454
Is this a cuticle?
In mint condition?

900
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:10,057
Is that a Kaiju skin parasite?

901
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,092
I've never seen them
alive before!

902
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:14,728
TheyThey usually die
as soon as the Kaiju falls!

903
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,296
I thought you couldn't
keep them alive!

904
00:57:16,298 --> 00:57:18,832
You can if you soak
'em in ammonia.

905
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:24,638
What do you want?

906
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,507
I'm looking for Hannibal Chau.

907
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,908
I was told he was here.

908
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:31,745
Who wants to know?

909
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:34,848
I really can't say.

910
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:39,686
Aah! Aah!

911
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,188
Stacker Pentecost sent me!

912
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,124
Aah! Aah!

913
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:46,527
Oh, that's great.
That's real great.

914
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,196
So I take it
you're Hannibal Chau, right?

915
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:50,464
You like the name?

916
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:51,832
I took it from, uh..

917
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,600
my favorite
historical character

918
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:55,936
And my secondFavorite Szechuan
restaurant in Brooklyn.

919
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:57,804
Now tell me what you want,

920
00:57:57,806 --> 00:58:01,775
Before I gut you like a pig
and feed you to the skin louse.

921
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,610
She can't control her drift,

922
00:58:03,612 --> 00:58:05,212
And he went out of phase first!

923
00:58:05,214 --> 00:58:07,147
We all know what happened.

924
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:09,550
We can't afford mistakes,
the Kaiju keep evolving,

925
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,118
They keep kicking our asses!

926
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,819
He's a hasBeen,
she's a rookie.

927
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,122
I don't want them protecting
my bomb run, sir.

928
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:20,027
You need to watch your tone,
Mr. Hansen.

929
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,563
Hey, stay there.

930
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,299
Give me a moment.

931
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:30,370
You two are a goddamn disgrace.

932
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:32,806
You're gonna get us all killed,

933
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,477
I want to come back
from this mission

934
00:58:37,479 --> 00:58:40,347
'Cause I quite like my life.

935
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:43,350
So why don't you just do us all
a favor and disappear?

936
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:44,751
It's the only thing
you're good at.

937
00:58:44,753 --> 00:58:46,653
Stop! Now!

938
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,522
Yeah, that's right.

939
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:50,357
You just hold back
your little girlfriend.

940
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,727
One of you bitches
needs a leash.

941
00:58:59,735 --> 00:59:02,903
Apologize to her.
Screw you.

942
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:13,580
Aah!

943
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:16,850
Aah!

944
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:23,156
I said apologize to her.

945
00:59:29,564 --> 00:59:31,765
Hey!
Hey! Enough!

946
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,267
What's going on?

947
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,335
On your feet, both of you!

948
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:43,210
Becket, Mori,
into my office, now.

949
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:44,611
No, we aren't finished!
Hey! Hey! This is over!

950
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:47,114
You're a ranger, for Chrissake.

951
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,548
Why don't you start
acting like one?

952
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:56,323
I went out of phase first.
It was my mistake.

953
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:58,458
No.

954
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,994
It was my mistake.

955
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:05,265
I should have never let you two
in the same machine.

956
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:06,767
So, what?

957
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,168
You're grounding us?

958
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:09,503
Not you.

959
01:00:16,477 --> 01:00:21,014
Permission
to be dismissed, sir.

960
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:26,653
Permission granted, miss Mori.

961
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,359
Mako.

962
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:37,431
Sir, what are you doing?

963
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:41,368
She is the strongest
candidate by far.

964
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,170
What other options do we have?

965
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,705
Huh? Tell me!

966
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:49,009
Do not let my calm demeanor
fool you, ranger!

967
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:53,613
Now is not a good moment
for your insubordination!

968
01:00:53,615 --> 01:00:55,449
Mako is too inexperienced

969
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,285
To rein in her memories
during combat.

970
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:03,957
That's not why
you grounded her.

971
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:07,627
I was in her memories.
I saw everything.

972
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,963
I don't care
what you think you saw.

973
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,744
I know what she means to you.

974
01:03:04,746 --> 01:03:06,346
I saw it! I..

975
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:07,914
Hey! Hey!

976
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,850
This conversation is over.

977
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,418
Marshal.

978
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,521
Marshal, can we just talk
about this for one second?!

979
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:20,827
You rescued her.

980
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:22,496
You raised her.

981
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:25,765
You're not protecting her now.

982
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:27,601
You are holding her back.

983
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:35,008
Don't you ever touch me again.

984
01:03:36,944 --> 01:03:39,546
Now, you have no idea
who the hell I am

985
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:41,181
Or where I've come from,

986
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:44,351
And I'm not about to tell you
my whole life story.

987
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:47,287
All I need to be to you
and everybody in this dome

988
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:49,289
Is a fixed point.

989
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,791
The last man standing.

990
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:55,395
I do not need your sympathy
or your admiration.

991
01:03:55,397 --> 01:03:59,666
All I need is your compliance
and your fighting skills.

992
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:02,068
And if I can't get that,

993
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:04,137
Then you can go back
to the wall

994
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:06,006
That I found you crawling on.

995
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,875
Do I make myself clear?

996
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:16,216
Yes, sir.

997
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:20,153
Good.

998
01:04:47,848 --> 01:04:49,849
I'm sorry.

999
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:53,053
I should've warned you.

1000
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,588
First drifts are rough.

1001
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,591
But you weren't just tapping
into my memories.

1002
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,293
You were tapping
into my brother's too.

1003
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:07,033
When Yancy was taken,
we were still connected.

1004
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,536
I felt his fear, his pain,

1005
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,639
His helplessness, and then..

1006
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:14,708
he was gone.

1007
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,644
I felt it.
I know.

1008
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:23,149
You know, you live in someone
else's head for so long

1009
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:25,785
The hardest part to deal with
is the silence.

1010
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:29,556
To let someone else in,
to really connect,

1011
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:32,559
You have to trust them.

1012
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:37,297
And today the drift was strong.

1013
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:45,171
Her heart.

1014
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:48,675
When's the last time
you saw it?

1015
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:51,544
Not in a long time.

1016
01:05:55,816 --> 01:05:58,418
Movement in the breach.

1017
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,020
Double event.

1018
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:04,591
Two signatures.

1019
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:09,329
Dilation indicator, category 4.

1020
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:20,640
Excuse me.

1021
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:22,942
The breach
was exposed at 2300 hours.

1022
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:24,944
We have two signatures,
both category 4s.

1023
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:26,680
Otachi and leatherback.

1024
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,281
They'll reach Hong Kong
within the hour.

1025
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:30,550
Evacuate the city.
Shut down the bridges.

1026
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:33,319
I want every single civilian
in a refuge right now.

1027
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:35,388
Crimson typhoon, cherno alpha,

1028
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,190
I want you to frontline
the harbor.

1029
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:38,692
Stay on the miracle mile.

1030
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,694
Striker,
I want you to stay back,

1031
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,128
Look after the coastline.

1032
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,730
We cannot afford to lose you,

1033
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:45,732
So only engage
as a final option.

1034
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:46,866
Yes, sir!

1035
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:47,867
You two.

1036
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:50,737
You stay put.

1037
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:52,038
Let's go!

1038
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:11,758
Loccent, striker's got the ball
and we're on the roll.

1039
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:17,497
Loccent.. near positions
and awaiting your orders.

1040
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:20,900
Remain in the miracle mile.
Engage at your discretion.

1041
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,702
Guys, keep your eyes open.

1042
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:24,871
These category 4s are
the biggest we've ever seen,

1043
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:26,239
Both in size and weight.

1044
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:30,076
Cherno alpha
reaching target zone.

1045
01:07:30,078 --> 01:07:31,811
Disengaging transport.

1046
01:07:51,098 --> 01:07:54,367
Cherno alpha in position.
Miracle mile.

1047
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:57,604
Cherno alpha
holding the coastline.

1048
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,938
Beacon is on.

1049
01:08:06,414 --> 01:08:09,282
Look at 'em.

1050
01:08:09,284 --> 01:08:11,718
They believe the Kaiju
are sent from heaven.

1051
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,820
That the gods are expressing
their displeasure

1052
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,121
With our behavior.

1053
01:08:15,123 --> 01:08:16,422
The silly bastards.

1054
01:08:16,424 --> 01:08:18,091
And what do you believe?

1055
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,726
Well..

1056
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:23,396
I believe that Kaiju bone powder
is 500 bucks a pound.

1057
01:08:23,398 --> 01:08:24,664
What do you want?

1058
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,066
I need to access a Kaiju brain.

1059
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:28,434
Completely intact.

1060
01:08:28,436 --> 01:08:29,435
No, no, no.

1061
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:30,670
The skull plate is so dense

1062
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:31,805
That by the time
you drill into it..

1063
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,106
The brain's rotted away.

1064
01:08:33,108 --> 01:08:35,074
But I'm talking about
the secondary brain.

1065
01:08:35,076 --> 01:08:37,076
Now we both know
that the Kaiju are so large

1066
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:39,445
They need two brains to move
around, like a dinosaur.

1067
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:40,980
I want to get my hands on that.

1068
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:42,749
Mm.

1069
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:46,152
What the hell do you want
a secondary brain for, anyway?

1070
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:48,688
I mean, every part
of the Kaiju sells.

1071
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,123
Cartilage, spleen, liver.

1072
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,357
Even the crap!

1073
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,959
One cubic meter of crap

1074
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:55,929
Has enough phosphorous in it
to fertilize a whole field!

1075
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,831
But the brain..

1076
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,632
too much ammonia.

1077
01:08:59,634 --> 01:09:02,001
So what's the deal,
little fella?

1078
01:09:02,003 --> 01:09:03,436
Well, that's classified.

1079
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:06,005
So I couldn't tell you.
Even if I wanted to.

1080
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:07,807
Mm.

1081
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,709
But it is pretty cool.

1082
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,544
So I might tell you.

1083
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,313
I'm gonna tell you.

1084
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,883
I figured out how to drift
with a Kaiju.

1085
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:19,352
Are you funnin' me, son?

1086
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:21,888
It's fascinating
how their minds work.

1087
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,624
Every single Kaiju,
his mind's connected.

1088
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:27,393
The species has like a..
Like a hive mind.

1089
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:32,198
Holy Jesus.

1090
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,400
You've gone and done it,
haven't you?

1091
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:37,103
I did it a little bit, yeah.

1092
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,442
You goddamn moron.

1093
01:11:16,603 --> 01:11:19,238
Loccent! Typhoon and alpha
are in trouble.

1094
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,673
We're movin' in!

1095
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:22,642
You are to hold your ground.
Do not engage.

1096
01:11:22,644 --> 01:11:24,310
We need you to carry that bomb.

1097
01:11:24,312 --> 01:11:25,545
Do you copy?

1098
01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:38,524
Jesus, we can't just sit here
and watch 'em die. Come on!

1099
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:42,028
Ah, screw this.
Loccent, we're movin' in now!

1100
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,962
Cherno alpha,
we've been hit with some type of acid!

1101
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:18,031
Come on!

1102
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,999
Hull has been compromised.
We need backup immediately!

1103
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:23,870
Just hold on, cherno!
We're on our way!

1104
01:12:56,103 --> 01:12:57,970
Our power move!
Yeah!

1105
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:26,099
We just lost cherno, sir.

1106
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,557
Engaging air missiles!

1107
01:14:18,486 --> 01:14:20,520
What's going on?
What happened?

1108
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,089
The blast. It jumbled all the
jaegers' electrical circuits.

1109
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,757
What the hell was that?

1110
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:26,025
Loccent!
I've never seen that before.

1111
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:28,094
Loccent!
They're adapting.

1112
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,829
This isn't a defense mechanism,
it's a weapon!

1113
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:31,330
Get me striker!

1114
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:32,865
Nothing, sir.
The mark 5's digital's fried.

1115
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:35,301
It'll take me two hours
to reroute the auxiliary.

1116
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:37,036
All the jaegers,
they're digital!

1117
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:38,304
Not all of them, marshal.

1118
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:41,040
Gipsy's analog.
Nuclear.

1119
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:57,623
We got two Kaijus.
We gotta get out.

1120
01:14:57,625 --> 01:15:00,493
Hang on a second. Excuse me.
WhWhat's going on?

1121
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:01,827
There are two goddamn Kaiju

1122
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:03,696
Headed straight
for Hong Kong city.

1123
01:15:03,698 --> 01:15:05,631
No, no, no. That's not possible.
There's never been two before.

1124
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:07,166
Well, maybe that's 'cause

1125
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:10,169
Nobody ever drifted with one
before, eh, genius?!

1126
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:12,638
When Jaeger pilots drift,
it's a twoWay street.

1127
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,407
A bridge, right?
Of course. Yes!

1128
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,675
It sets up a connection.

1129
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,310
Both ways!

1130
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:20,246
"A hive mentality," you said!

1131
01:15:20,248 --> 01:15:22,882
Maybe those Kaiju
are tryin' to find you.

1132
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:24,750
What.. What're
we gonna do?

1133
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,219
I'm gonna wait out
this shitstorm

1134
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,720
In my own private Kaiju bunker.

1135
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:30,189
But you are going
to a public refuge.

1136
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:34,527
I tried it once.
Once.

1137
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:35,928
Now get the hell outta here.

1138
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,100
Excuse me!

1139
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:14,602
Aah!

1140
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:31,217
Move! Move!
I'm a doctor! I'm a doctor!

1141
01:16:32,786 --> 01:16:36,088
Okay, hold on.
Let me in.

1142
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,224
Okay, I'm a doctor.
Okay, let me in, I'm a doctor.

1143
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:44,964
Please proceed immediately
to your antiKaiju refuge.

1144
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,417
There's no emergency power.

1145
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,852
We gotta bail.
I'm gonna try somethin' else.

1146
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:08,287
No!
Don't disengage!

1147
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:11,590
Aah! My arm!

1148
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:14,160
Hey! Come on!
Get on your feet, old man!

1149
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:17,196
Don't call me that!

1150
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:25,304
He's right outside.
We gotta get outta here now!

1151
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:26,772
We're not goin' anywhere!

1152
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:28,207
Now you and I
are the only thing

1153
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:29,709
Standin' between
that ugly bastard

1154
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,277
And a city of 2 million people.

1155
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,478
Now we have a choice here.

1156
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,512
We either sit and wait

1157
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:35,848
Or we take these flare guns

1158
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,884
And do something really stupid.

1159
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:53,165
How's your arm?
Ah, just give me the gun.

1160
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:55,568
Hey, you!

1161
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,980
I think we just pissed it off!

1162
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:35,241
All right, Mako.
Get ready, this is for real!

1163
01:18:46,386 --> 01:18:48,454
Yeah!

1164
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:50,489
Come on, gipsy!
Kick his ass!

1165
01:19:37,972 --> 01:19:42,408
Come on! Let's do this!
Together!

1166
01:20:00,694 --> 01:20:04,096
Elbow rocket!

1167
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:05,331
Now!

1168
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:22,681
Aah!

1169
01:20:46,339 --> 01:20:48,474
Hang on, Mako!

1170
01:21:06,426 --> 01:21:08,027
Plasma cannon, now!

1171
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,496
Plasma cannon engaged.

1172
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:19,238
Empty the clip!

1173
01:21:52,539 --> 01:21:54,273
Wait.

1174
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:57,876
I think this guy's dead.

1175
01:21:57,878 --> 01:21:59,545
But let's check for a pulse.

1176
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,980
Okay.

1177
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:12,358
No pulse.

1178
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:43,589
He stopped right above us.

1179
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,357
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

1180
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,961
This isn't a refuge. This is..
This is a buffet line!

1181
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:54,933
He knows I'm here.

1182
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:56,535
He knows I'm here!

1183
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:58,037
He knows we're all here!

1184
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,938
No, you don't understand,
he's trying to get me!

1185
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,007
He knows I'm here
and he's trying to get me!

1186
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:03,709
What was that?
What did you say?!

1187
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,444
What was she saying?!

1188
01:23:05,446 --> 01:23:06,945
I gotta get out of here!
Let me out of here!

1189
01:23:06,947 --> 01:23:09,882
I got..
Ah, come on!

1190
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:12,885
Those were expensive glasses.

1191
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,486
This is the worst.

1192
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:30,295
Torque engaged.

1193
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:25,484
I can't pinpoint it.
It's movin' quick.

1194
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:27,986
Keep your eyes open.

1195
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:32,758
Choppers,
do you have a visual? Over.

1196
01:26:15,735 --> 01:26:17,135
Come on!

1197
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:41,894
I'll hold it!

1198
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,428
Vent the coolant
on the left flank!

1199
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:44,830
Coolant venting.

1200
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,732
Co2 purge.
Venting coolant.

1201
01:27:50,063 --> 01:27:52,464
Atmosphere loss in progress.

1202
01:27:52,466 --> 01:27:55,000
Temperature's droppin'!
We're losing oxygen!

1203
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:56,468
Both plasma cannons are shot.

1204
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,903
We're out of options, Mako.

1205
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:04,409
Sword deployment.

1206
01:28:25,031 --> 01:28:28,266
Altitude actuation
offBalance.

1207
01:28:28,268 --> 01:28:32,504
50,000 feet to ground contact.

1208
01:28:34,007 --> 01:28:37,042
Look, there!

1209
01:28:37,044 --> 01:28:40,178
Altitude loss critical.

1210
01:28:41,548 --> 01:28:42,914
40,000 feet.

1211
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:47,285
Gipsy, listen to me!

1212
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:49,021
Loosen all the shock absorbers,

1213
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:51,289
Use your gyroscope as balance
and ball up!

1214
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:53,191
It's your only chance!

1215
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:56,628
20,000 feet.

1216
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,397
Fuel purge!

1217
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,098
Now!

1218
01:29:01,734 --> 01:29:04,036
Impact alert.

1219
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:05,804
We're comin' in too fast.

1220
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:09,107
We're comin' in too fast.
Brace for impact, ma..

1221
01:29:37,003 --> 01:29:39,604
Mako, talk to me.

1222
01:29:41,574 --> 01:29:43,875
Mako, you okay?

1223
01:29:43,877 --> 01:29:46,778
Yeah.

1224
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:48,046
You?

1225
01:30:02,295 --> 01:30:05,063
Go to dr. Geiszler now!
Yes, sir!

1226
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:08,066
I want the two remaining jaegers
back to 100% functionality.

1227
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:09,401
Yes, sir!

1228
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:12,104
We're gonna harvest

1229
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:14,372
The skin,
the talons and the wing.

1230
01:30:14,374 --> 01:30:16,608
Germans are gonna go nuts
for that stuff.

1231
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:18,810
Let me see that map.

1232
01:30:20,413 --> 01:30:22,114
Here is where the Kaiju fell,

1233
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:24,549
Here's where we concentrate
our efforts.

1234
01:30:24,551 --> 01:30:26,284
We'll get it, boss.
Right.

1235
01:30:26,286 --> 01:30:27,686
Hey!

1236
01:30:30,089 --> 01:30:32,991
Okay, guess who's back,
you oneEyed bitch?

1237
01:30:32,993 --> 01:30:35,794
And you owe me a Kaiju brain.

1238
01:30:46,973 --> 01:30:49,374
Raleigh!

1239
01:30:55,448 --> 01:30:57,816
My kid'd never admit it..

1240
01:30:57,818 --> 01:30:59,951
but he's grateful.

1241
01:30:59,953 --> 01:31:01,219
We both are.

1242
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:08,126
Mr. Becket!

1243
01:31:08,128 --> 01:31:11,696
Miss Mori!

1244
01:31:11,698 --> 01:31:13,865
In all of my years fighting..

1245
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:20,705
I've never seen anything
like that.

1246
01:31:20,707 --> 01:31:22,941
Well done.

1247
01:31:22,943 --> 01:31:25,010
Proud of you.

1248
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:28,446
Proud of us all.

1249
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,315
But..

1250
01:31:30,317 --> 01:31:36,721
as harsh as it sounds,
there is no time to celebrate.

1251
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:41,993
We lost two crews.

1252
01:31:41,995 --> 01:31:45,297
No time to grieve.

1253
01:31:48,134 --> 01:31:50,302
Reset that clock.

1254
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:04,616
Reset the clock.

1255
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:38,617
I still can't believe
what you did to me.

1256
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:40,185
I mean, I coulda been eaten.

1257
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:42,020
Well, that was definitely
the plan.

1258
01:32:42,022 --> 01:32:44,422
Lucky for you, that didn't
become necessary, huh?

1259
01:32:44,424 --> 01:32:46,191
Okay. Thank you so much.
You're so kind.

1260
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,859
I really appreciate
all of this.

1261
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,095
But now do you mind tellin' me
exactly what is taking so long

1262
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,630
For your workers
to get that brain?

1263
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:53,732
Well, they pump the cavity
full of co2,

1264
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,067
Just like in any other
laparoscopic surgery.

1265
01:32:56,069 --> 01:32:57,636
Okay, yes, obviously,

1266
01:32:57,638 --> 01:33:00,305
The co2's gonna delay
the acidic reaction, yes.

1267
01:33:00,307 --> 01:33:02,073
And it allows us to harvest.

1268
01:33:02,075 --> 01:33:04,876
But our boys need oxygen pumped
into their suits.

1269
01:33:04,878 --> 01:33:06,111
They move slow.

1270
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:07,912
What's goin' on in there, boys?

1271
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:09,981
We've reached..

1272
01:33:09,983 --> 01:33:11,616
The upper pelvic area.

1273
01:33:11,618 --> 01:33:14,819
Moving to the 25th vertebra.

1274
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:16,488
Shit.

1275
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:18,623
Even through the suit, boss,

1276
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:21,860
It smells like dead catfish
in here.

1277
01:33:23,996 --> 01:33:26,931
Boss.

1278
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:29,968
The secondary brain..

1279
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,102
is damage.
Oh.

1280
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:32,437
It's ruin. Destroy.

1281
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:34,072
Bitch!
How could they screw that up?!

1282
01:33:34,074 --> 01:33:35,307
Wait. Wait.

1283
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,741
What was that?

1284
01:33:36,743 --> 01:33:38,410
Did he say "wait"?
Why wait?

1285
01:33:40,946 --> 01:33:42,414
Do you hear that?

1286
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:44,616
It's like a heartbeat.

1287
01:33:44,618 --> 01:33:46,918
Oh, my god.

1288
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,120
Oh, my god, this can't be.
Hold on a second.

1289
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:50,922
Hey!
Let me have that!

1290
01:33:50,924 --> 01:33:52,824
Shh, shh!
Listen, listen!

1291
01:33:52,826 --> 01:33:54,726
Listen to this.

1292
01:34:02,702 --> 01:34:05,203
It's pregnant.

1293
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,395
No, no!

1294
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,063
Please.

1295
01:35:05,065 --> 01:35:08,199
No! No.

1296
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,048
I knew it.

1297
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,583
Aah!

1298
01:35:25,585 --> 01:35:27,051
Gone.

1299
01:35:27,053 --> 01:35:30,054
His lungs weren't fully formed.

1300
01:35:30,056 --> 01:35:33,458
Umbilical cord
tied around his neck.

1301
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:36,795
No way he could survive
outside the womb

1302
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:38,730
For more than a minute.

1303
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,765
One look, that's all I needed.

1304
01:35:40,767 --> 01:35:42,634
I knew he wouldn't make it.

1305
01:35:52,245 --> 01:35:53,378
Ugly little bastard.

1306
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,346
Anyway, I woulda..

1307
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,468
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1308
01:36:29,682 --> 01:36:31,416
Huh.

1309
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:43,628
How sick are you?

1310
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:45,763
And why didn't you tell me?

1311
01:36:45,765 --> 01:36:48,600
Ah.

1312
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:52,704
What's to tell?

1313
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:55,106
You know, them mark 1s,

1314
01:36:55,108 --> 01:37:00,678
We scraped them bad boys
together in 14 months.

1315
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:05,550
Last thing we were thinking
about was radiation shielding.

1316
01:37:05,552 --> 01:37:10,054
I ran nearly a dozen missions.

1317
01:37:10,056 --> 01:37:12,991
I stayed under
the medical radar for awhile

1318
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,361
But the last time I jockeyed
was Tokyo.

1319
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:19,864
I finished the fight solo,
but for three hours..

1320
01:37:19,866 --> 01:37:21,900
I burned.

1321
01:37:21,902 --> 01:37:24,836
They warned me if I ever stepped
foot into a Jaeger again,

1322
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:26,271
The toll would be too much.

1323
01:37:28,874 --> 01:37:32,043
You and I are the only two
that ever ran solo combat.

1324
01:37:32,045 --> 01:37:34,746
That's why I brought you here.

1325
01:37:44,056 --> 01:37:46,157
What is it?
Sir, it's happening.

1326
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,659
I just got two signatures

1327
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:50,328
With unprecedented dilation,
40Meter spikes.

1328
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:51,696
What category?

1329
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:53,364
Checking the ratios,
category four.

1330
01:37:53,366 --> 01:37:55,033
Where're they headed?

1331
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,901
That's the thing,
they're not headin' anywhere.

1332
01:37:56,903 --> 01:37:59,003
They're hovering
just above the breach.

1333
01:37:59,005 --> 01:38:01,072
It's.. It's like they're
protecting it or something.

1334
01:38:01,074 --> 01:38:03,541
All right, gipsy, striker,
on deck.

1335
01:38:03,543 --> 01:38:05,944
Sir, Herc cannot ride.
His arm..

1336
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:07,745
You heard me.

1337
01:38:07,747 --> 01:38:10,048
Two signatures.

1338
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:13,017
Two?! There are..

1339
01:38:13,019 --> 01:38:15,286
There are two Kaiju signatures
in the breach,

1340
01:38:15,288 --> 01:38:17,021
Not three like I predicted?!

1341
01:38:17,023 --> 01:38:19,524
Hermann! I haven't exactly had
a very good day, okay?!

1342
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:21,292
I got about 5 minutes..

1343
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:22,560
should be three Kaijus.

1344
01:38:22,562 --> 01:38:24,262
..before brain death
occurs here!

1345
01:38:24,264 --> 01:38:26,764
I don't wanna spend it talking
about your theories!

1346
01:38:26,766 --> 01:38:28,366
This is all wrong!

1347
01:38:28,368 --> 01:38:30,702
There should be three Kaijus
coming through, not two!

1348
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:32,203
There should be three
and there's two?

1349
01:38:32,205 --> 01:38:34,372
I'm sorry, it hurts to be wrong,
doesn't it, Hermann?

1350
01:38:34,374 --> 01:38:35,940
I am not wrong, but there is something
here that we don't understand.

1351
01:38:35,942 --> 01:38:37,742
Okay. Hermann, hopefully
we can argue about any mistakes

1352
01:38:37,744 --> 01:38:39,544
You made in your predictive
model in the future!

1353
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:40,812
But in the meantime,

1354
01:38:40,814 --> 01:38:42,080
The neural interface
is way off the charts!

1355
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,381
If you want to help,
help with that!

1356
01:38:43,383 --> 01:38:45,383
Newton, I am not wrong.

1357
01:38:45,385 --> 01:38:47,251
There is only one way
to make sure..

1358
01:38:47,253 --> 01:38:49,988
and that is to do this..

1359
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,589
together.

1360
01:38:51,591 --> 01:38:54,125
I'll go with you.

1361
01:38:54,127 --> 01:38:57,061
That's what
the Jaeger pilots do,

1362
01:38:57,063 --> 01:38:58,930
Share the neural load.

1363
01:38:58,932 --> 01:39:02,734
You're serious?
You.. You would do that for me?

1364
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:05,336
Or you would do that with me?

1365
01:39:05,338 --> 01:39:09,007
Well, with worldwide destruction
a certain alternative..

1366
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:10,742
do I really have a choice?

1367
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:13,845
"We're gonna own this bad boy!"

1368
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:18,483
By Jove, we are going to own
this thing for sure!

1369
01:39:23,922 --> 01:39:27,325
Oi, Tendo.
Tendo!

1370
01:39:27,327 --> 01:39:28,660
You're not suited up.

1371
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:30,428
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Elvis.

1372
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:32,163
I need to know what's going on.

1373
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:33,798
He said suit up, so suit up.

1374
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,768
Tendo, I can't pilot striker
on my own, now, can I?!

1375
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,203
Dad's hurt, so who's gonna
be my copilot?

1376
01:40:01,026 --> 01:40:04,862
I don't remember it
being so tight.

1377
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:11,502
Getting back into that Jaeger
will kill you.

1378
01:40:11,504 --> 01:40:14,872
Not gettin' into one
would kill us all.

1379
01:40:14,874 --> 01:40:19,711
Listen, you are a brave girl.

1380
01:40:19,713 --> 01:40:23,815
I'm so lucky
to have seen you grow.

1381
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:27,485
But if I'm going to do this..

1382
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:31,923
I need you to protect me.

1383
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,462
Can you do that?

1384
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:43,000
Hey.

1385
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:49,907
Everyone, listen up!

1386
01:40:56,415 --> 01:40:58,783
Today..

1387
01:40:58,785 --> 01:41:01,753
today..

1388
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:04,422
at the edge of our hope..

1389
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:11,062
at the end of our time..

1390
01:41:11,064 --> 01:41:16,033
we have chosen not only
to believe in ourselves,

1391
01:41:16,035 --> 01:41:18,202
But in each other.

1392
01:41:18,204 --> 01:41:20,972
Today there's not a man
nor woman in here

1393
01:41:20,974 --> 01:41:22,573
That shall stand alone.

1394
01:41:22,575 --> 01:41:25,409
Not today.

1395
01:41:25,411 --> 01:41:29,647
Today we face the monsters
that are at our door

1396
01:41:29,649 --> 01:41:32,250
And bring the fight to them!

1397
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:36,621
Today we are canceling
the apocalypse!

1398
01:41:51,604 --> 01:41:54,372
Go to the safety zone
right now.

1399
01:41:56,108 --> 01:41:57,608
Hey, marshal!

1400
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:00,178
You know,
that was a great speech,

1401
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,446
But how exactly are you and I

1402
01:42:02,448 --> 01:42:04,982
Supposed to match up in there?

1403
01:42:04,984 --> 01:42:07,652
I carry nothing into the drift.

1404
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:10,188
No memories, no fear.
No rank.

1405
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,489
And as for you..

1406
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:13,758
well, you're easy.

1407
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,460
You're an egotistical jerk
with daddy issues.

1408
01:42:16,462 --> 01:42:18,696
A simple puzzle I solved
on day one.

1409
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:23,467
But you are
your father's son..

1410
01:42:23,469 --> 01:42:25,503
so we'll drift just fine.

1411
01:42:25,505 --> 01:42:28,940
Works for me.

1412
01:42:43,322 --> 01:42:45,056
Hey, now.

1413
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:53,865
When you drift with someone,

1414
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:57,068
You feel like there's nothing
to talk about.

1415
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:00,905
I just don't want to regret

1416
01:43:00,907 --> 01:43:03,241
All the things
that I never said out loud.

1417
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:05,042
Don't.

1418
01:43:06,646 --> 01:43:08,980
You don't need to.

1419
01:43:12,084 --> 01:43:15,152
I know them all.

1420
01:43:15,154 --> 01:43:17,321
I always have.

1421
01:43:18,858 --> 01:43:21,192
Hey.
Hey, handsome.

1422
01:43:24,163 --> 01:43:26,831
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

1423
01:43:32,905 --> 01:43:36,674
You look after him for me.

1424
01:43:36,676 --> 01:43:38,242
Stacker.

1425
01:43:40,412 --> 01:43:43,014
That's my son you got there.

1426
01:43:45,017 --> 01:43:47,518
My son.

1427
01:43:51,957 --> 01:43:56,694
You know, Mako, all those years
I spent livin' in the past,

1428
01:43:56,696 --> 01:44:00,264
I never really thought
about the future.

1429
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:03,067
Until now.

1430
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:09,006
I never did have
very good timing.

1431
01:44:26,792 --> 01:44:28,125
You ready for this?

1432
01:44:28,127 --> 01:44:29,493
Oh, yes, yes.

1433
01:44:29,495 --> 01:44:32,730
Initiating neural
handshake in 5..

1434
01:44:32,732 --> 01:44:37,134
4, 3, 2, 1.

1435
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:02,093
Are you okay?

1436
01:45:02,095 --> 01:45:04,095
Yes, of course.

1437
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:06,764
I'm completely fine.

1438
01:45:14,339 --> 01:45:16,173
The drift.
You saw it?

1439
01:45:16,175 --> 01:45:17,441
Yeah.
Did you?

1440
01:45:17,443 --> 01:45:19,210
Listen, we have to warn them.

1441
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:22,513
The jaegers..
The breach.. The plan..

1442
01:45:22,515 --> 01:45:25,049
It's not going to work.

1443
01:45:25,051 --> 01:45:29,020
Disengaging transport.

1444
01:45:38,196 --> 01:45:40,197
Loccent, all ports sealed.

1445
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,866
Ready to submerge.

1446
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,628
All ports sealed.
Ready to submerge.

1447
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:53,544
Both neural handshakes at 100%.

1448
01:45:53,546 --> 01:45:56,213
Neural handshake
confirmed, sir.

1449
01:45:56,215 --> 01:45:59,083
Two actives still in circle
formation in the Guam quadrant.

1450
01:45:59,085 --> 01:46:01,652
Scunner, Raiju.

1451
01:46:01,654 --> 01:46:03,888
 Both category 4.
 Roger that.

1452
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:07,558
Half a mile to
the ocean cliff, we jump!

1453
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:09,827
It's 3,000 meters
to the breach.

1454
01:46:09,829 --> 01:46:12,363
Half a mile?! I can't even see
a damn inch ahead!

1455
01:46:12,365 --> 01:46:15,266
How are we supposed
to deliver the bomb?

1456
01:46:17,235 --> 01:46:18,769
Visibility's zero.

1457
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:20,271
Switching to instruments now.

1458
01:46:29,582 --> 01:46:31,415
Sir!

1459
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:33,784
Gipsy, you have movement
on your right. Three o'clock!

1460
01:46:33,786 --> 01:46:35,119
Three o'clock!

1461
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:36,921
100 feet radius, clear.

1462
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:38,923
Right flank's clear.
I got nothing.

1463
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:40,391
Left now!
And movin' fast!

1464
01:46:40,393 --> 01:46:41,859
Fastest Kaiju on record!

1465
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:48,399
I don't see anything.
It's movin' too fast!

1466
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:52,536
Eyes on the prize, gipsy.
600 meters from the drop.

1467
01:47:16,962 --> 01:47:20,364
400 meters and closing.

1468
01:47:24,269 --> 01:47:27,438
Bogeys are stopping.

1469
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,607
Striker!
Bogeys are stopping.

1470
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:31,842
One o'clock.

1471
01:47:31,844 --> 01:47:32,910
Marshal, what are you doing?!

1472
01:47:32,912 --> 01:47:34,078
They're stopping.

1473
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,846
Why the hell
are they stopping?!

1474
01:47:35,848 --> 01:47:37,982
I don't give a damn, sir!
We're 300 meters from the jump!

1475
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:39,850
 Something's not right!
 Striker, the bogeys aren't following.

1476
01:47:39,852 --> 01:47:41,685
Take the leap now!

1477
01:47:41,687 --> 01:47:44,288
Don't do it! Don't do it,
it's not gonna work!

1478
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:45,923
Move, you fascist!

1479
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:47,591
Blowing up the breach,
it's not gonna work!

1480
01:47:47,593 --> 01:47:48,926
What do you mean?
What's not gonna work?

1481
01:47:48,928 --> 01:47:50,694
Sir, just because
the breach is open

1482
01:47:50,696 --> 01:47:52,463
Does not mean you're gonna be
able to get a bomb through.

1483
01:47:52,465 --> 01:47:54,431
The breach
genetically reads the Kaiju

1484
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:55,933
Like a barcode at the supermarket
and then lets them pass.

1485
01:47:55,935 --> 01:47:57,368
Okay, so you're gonna have
to fool the breach

1486
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:58,636
Into thinking that you have
the same code!

1487
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:01,272
And how are we supposed
to do that?

1488
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:02,840
By making it think
you are a Kaiju.

1489
01:48:02,842 --> 01:48:04,308
You have to lock onto the Kaiju,
ride it into the breach.

1490
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:05,676
The throat will then read

1491
01:48:05,678 --> 01:48:07,611
The Kaiju's genetic code
and let you pass.

1492
01:48:07,613 --> 01:48:10,114
If you don't do it, the bomb
will deflect off the breach

1493
01:48:10,116 --> 01:48:12,216
Like it always has
and the mission will fail.

1494
01:48:12,218 --> 01:48:14,451
All right, now that
you've heard all that,

1495
01:48:14,453 --> 01:48:16,120
Striker, take the leap!

1496
01:48:16,122 --> 01:48:18,489
Sir! I have a third signature
emerging from the breach!

1497
01:48:18,491 --> 01:48:20,324
Third signature
emerging from the breach.

1498
01:48:20,326 --> 01:48:21,792
It's a triple event.

1499
01:48:21,794 --> 01:48:23,127
Oh, god, I was right.

1500
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:26,664
How big is it?
What category?

1501
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:27,898
Category 5.

1502
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,067
Striker,

1503
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:31,902
It's a category 5.

1504
01:48:31,904 --> 01:48:33,904
The first ever.

1505
01:48:57,729 --> 01:48:59,396
Striker, we see him.

1506
01:48:59,398 --> 01:49:01,599
We're right behind you,
about 100 meters.

1507
01:49:01,601 --> 01:49:03,901
We're gonna come around
your three o'clock,

1508
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:05,236
Try to flank him.

1509
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:06,670
Standard twoTeam
formation.

1510
01:49:06,672 --> 01:49:08,505
Just keep him busy
for a few mi..

1511
01:49:20,885 --> 01:49:22,853
Brace for impact!

1512
01:49:29,361 --> 01:49:30,995
Chain sword deployed.

1513
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:59,223
Let's get this son of a bitch!

1514
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,512
Gipsy, comin' up
on your 12 o'clock!

1515
01:50:21,514 --> 01:50:23,347
Full speed!

1516
01:50:23,349 --> 01:50:25,416
Get out of the way!

1517
01:50:44,769 --> 01:50:46,036
The release is jammed!

1518
01:50:46,038 --> 01:50:48,639
We can't deliver
the payload, sir!

1519
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:50,974
We're still armed.

1520
01:50:50,976 --> 01:50:52,943
But the hull is compromised!

1521
01:50:52,945 --> 01:50:54,478
Half our systems
are offline, sir.

1522
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,879
We need to override the..

1523
01:51:00,285 --> 01:51:01,518
Aah!

1524
01:51:43,328 --> 01:51:46,230
Both Kaijus converging
on striker fast!

1525
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:52,836
Hang on, striker!
We're comin' to ya!

1526
01:51:52,838 --> 01:51:55,406
No! Gipsy!
Do not come to our aid!

1527
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:56,874
Do you copy?
Hang on!

1528
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,275
Stay as far back as you can!

1529
01:51:58,277 --> 01:52:00,677
We can still reach you.
We're comin' for you.

1530
01:52:00,679 --> 01:52:03,080
No, Raleigh, listen to me.

1531
01:52:03,082 --> 01:52:05,082
You know exactly
what you have to do!

1532
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:06,450
Gipsy is nuclear!

1533
01:52:06,452 --> 01:52:08,285
Take her to the breach!

1534
01:52:08,287 --> 01:52:09,753
I hear you, sir.

1535
01:52:09,755 --> 01:52:11,422
Headin' for the breach.

1536
01:52:11,424 --> 01:52:13,857
Structural damage, 80%.
Now..

1537
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:17,594
Mako. Listen.

1538
01:52:17,596 --> 01:52:21,465
You can finish this.

1539
01:52:21,467 --> 01:52:24,301
I'll always be here for you.

1540
01:52:24,303 --> 01:52:27,704
You can always find me
in the drift.

1541
01:52:34,313 --> 01:52:35,979
We're a walking
nuclear reactor.

1542
01:52:35,981 --> 01:52:38,115
We can destroy the breach.

1543
01:52:50,763 --> 01:52:53,597
What can we do, sir?

1544
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:55,732
We can clear a path!

1545
01:52:55,734 --> 01:52:58,335
For the lady!

1546
01:52:58,337 --> 01:53:00,437
They're gonna detonate
the payload.

1547
01:53:03,242 --> 01:53:06,176
He said if you have the shot,
you take it!

1548
01:53:06,178 --> 01:53:09,580
So let's do this!

1549
01:53:09,582 --> 01:53:12,649
It was a pleasure, sir.

1550
01:53:38,276 --> 01:53:39,276
Sensei.

1551
01:53:39,278 --> 01:53:40,978
Aishitemasu.

1552
01:54:10,642 --> 01:54:12,409
All systems critical.

1553
01:54:12,411 --> 01:54:14,244
Fluid loss.

1554
01:54:14,246 --> 01:54:16,413
Systems are critical!

1555
01:54:16,415 --> 01:54:18,315
Fuel is leaking!

1556
01:54:18,317 --> 01:54:19,383
Our right leg's crippled!

1557
01:54:19,385 --> 01:54:20,851
Code red.

1558
01:54:20,853 --> 01:54:23,186
Let's finish this.
All systems critical.

1559
01:54:23,188 --> 01:54:25,322
What are they doing?

1560
01:54:25,324 --> 01:54:27,057
Finishing the mission.

1561
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:29,359
Loccent.
We have the Kaiju carcass.

1562
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:31,428
We're heading for the breach.

1563
01:54:34,232 --> 01:54:36,366
You guys better be right.

1564
01:54:36,368 --> 01:54:41,104
'Cause one way or another,
we're gettin' this thing done.

1565
01:54:52,383 --> 01:54:55,118
On my count, rear jets!

1566
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:59,256
Three, two, one.

1567
01:54:59,258 --> 01:55:00,424
Now!

1568
01:55:09,033 --> 01:55:10,801
Hold on.

1569
01:55:23,214 --> 01:55:26,216
Mako's oxygen is down.
Half capacity!

1570
01:55:26,218 --> 01:55:27,250
Can you reroute it?

1571
01:55:27,252 --> 01:55:28,885
I'm tryin', sir.

1572
01:55:28,887 --> 01:55:30,654
Hold on, Mako.
Heat shaft purge.

1573
01:55:30,656 --> 01:55:34,491
I'm gonna burn
this son of a bitch.

1574
01:55:51,743 --> 01:55:52,909
They're in.

1575
01:55:52,911 --> 01:55:55,012
They're in!
It worked.

1576
01:56:08,426 --> 01:56:13,196
Oxygen main, left hemisphere,
critical levels.

1577
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:18,802
Operating at 15% capacity.

1578
01:56:18,804 --> 01:56:20,937
10% capacity.

1579
01:56:20,939 --> 01:56:22,606
5% capacity.

1580
01:56:22,608 --> 01:56:26,009
He's givin' her his oxygen.

1581
01:56:26,011 --> 01:56:28,145
Right hemisphere oxygen..

1582
01:56:28,147 --> 01:56:29,613
It's okay now, Mako.

1583
01:56:29,615 --> 01:56:30,647
..Critical level.

1584
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:32,049
We did it.

1585
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:34,885
I can finish this alone.

1586
01:56:34,887 --> 01:56:37,387
All I have to do is fall.

1587
01:56:37,389 --> 01:56:40,190
Anyone can fall.

1588
01:56:40,192 --> 01:56:43,960
Raleigh, your oxygen
levels are critical now.

1589
01:56:43,962 --> 01:56:45,662
You don't have much time.

1590
01:56:45,664 --> 01:56:48,365
Start the core meltdown
and get out of there.

1591
01:56:48,367 --> 01:56:49,366
Do you hear me?

1592
01:56:49,368 --> 01:56:51,201
Get out of there now!

1593
01:56:58,643 --> 01:57:01,912
One pod is ejected.
No detonation, sir.

1594
01:57:01,914 --> 01:57:03,580
Loccent,
if you can still hear me,

1595
01:57:03,582 --> 01:57:06,850
I'm initiating
reactor override now.

1596
01:57:09,555 --> 01:57:11,354
Manual activation required.

1597
01:57:11,356 --> 01:57:13,190
What's goin' on?!
Trigger's offline!

1598
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:14,391
He has to do it by hand.

1599
01:57:14,393 --> 01:57:15,592
He's out of time.

1600
01:57:15,594 --> 01:57:16,893
He has to
selfDestruct now.

1601
01:57:18,763 --> 01:57:21,932
Manual activation required.

1602
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:35,145
No!

1603
01:57:51,095 --> 01:57:54,397
Manual override initiated.

1604
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:57,701
Core meltdown in tMinus 60.

1605
01:57:57,703 --> 01:58:01,138
Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds.

1606
01:58:03,908 --> 01:58:05,776
50 seconds.

1607
01:58:37,142 --> 01:58:40,877
Evac pod engaged.

1608
01:58:47,185 --> 01:58:54,291
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1609
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:56,693
Reactor meltdown commence.

1610
01:59:02,633 --> 01:59:05,001
Direct hit!
The breach has collapsed!

1611
01:59:08,106 --> 01:59:09,706
To the choppers!

1612
01:59:09,708 --> 01:59:11,842
To the choppers now!

1613
01:59:28,226 --> 01:59:30,660
Visuals on first pod.

1614
01:59:30,662 --> 01:59:33,430
Tracking solid.
Vital signs are good.

1615
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:41,538
Okay, where's the second pod?

1616
01:59:41,540 --> 01:59:44,708
I'm tracking it, but I'm
getting no vital signs.

1617
02:00:11,002 --> 02:00:13,503
I can't find his pulse.

1618
02:00:13,505 --> 02:00:15,005
I don't think he's breathing.

1619
02:00:15,007 --> 02:00:16,206
Can you read his pulse?

1620
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:17,941
Does he have a pulse?
Raleigh?

1621
02:00:17,943 --> 02:00:19,342
Raleigh?
I don't know.

1622
02:00:19,344 --> 02:00:21,378
Mako, listen to me.

1623
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,880
It could be the sensors
are not working.

1624
02:00:23,882 --> 02:00:25,415
We can't be sure.

1625
02:00:25,417 --> 02:00:26,583
No.

1626
02:00:26,585 --> 02:00:29,686
No. Don't go.

1627
02:00:29,688 --> 02:00:31,621
Mako.

1628
02:00:31,623 --> 02:00:33,556
No. Don't go.

1629
02:00:33,558 --> 02:00:36,092
Mako.

1630
02:00:38,596 --> 02:00:41,631
Don't go. Please.

1631
02:00:43,367 --> 02:00:46,069
You're squeezing me too tight.

1632
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:54,477
I couldn't breathe.

1633
02:01:09,994 --> 02:01:12,162
This is
marshal Hercules Hansen.

1634
02:01:12,164 --> 02:01:15,732
The breach is sealed.

1635
02:01:15,734 --> 02:01:17,000
Stop the clock!

1636
02:01:44,328 --> 02:01:46,997
Mako, Raleigh.
We have your position.

1637
02:01:46,999 --> 02:01:50,200
The choppers are on their way.
JJust hang on.

1638
02:01:53,271 --> 02:01:55,605
Are you okay?

1639
02:01:55,607 --> 02:01:58,808
Do you copy?

1640
02:01:58,810 --> 02:02:01,277
Uh, guys?
