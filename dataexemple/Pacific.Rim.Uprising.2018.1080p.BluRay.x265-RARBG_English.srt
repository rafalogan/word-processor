<i>My generation...</i>

2
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,129
<i>we were born into war.</i>

3
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:53,903
<i>Giant monsters attacked
our world.</i>

4
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,739
<i>We called 'em Kaiju.</i>

5
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:02,010
<i>They came through the Breach.</i>

6
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,180
<i>A gateway to another dimension</i>

7
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>at the bottom
of the Pacific Ocean.</i>

8
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:10,118
<i>They were sent by an alien race
on the other side...</i>

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,055
<i>the Precursors.</i>

10
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,924
<i>We fought back,</i>

11
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,026
<i>building our own monsters.</i>

12
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:21,163
<i>Jaegars... giant robots.</i>

13
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,968
<i>So big they needed
two pilots to run 'em.</i>

14
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,638

<i>decommissioned
Jaeger scrapyard.</i>

41
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,153
<i>Big risks mean big reward,</i>

42
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:53,889
<i>and nothing pays more
than stolen Jaeger tech.</i>

43
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,257
<i>Plenty of nutcases out here</i>

44
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,899
<i>trying to slap together
their own Jaegers.</i>

45
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:03,465
<i>But they need
the parts to do it.</i>

46
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:07,271
<i>So, if you can steal
what no one else can steal...</i>

47
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:12,174
<i>...you can live like a king.</i>

48
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,448
Are you sure it's in here?

49
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,351
Power cores are stripped
before they get decommissioned.

50
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:25,120
But sometimes they miss
the tertiary plasma capacitors.

51
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,988
And that's a big score.

52
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,757
This one's still
holding a charge.

53
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,959
Oh.

54
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,161
You better hope so.

55
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,197
Okay.

56
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,332
Let's just calm down.

57
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,433
Let's not get excited.

58
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm just playing the odds here.

59
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:39,935
You cheated Barada in Juarez,

60
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,070
skipped out on Chau
in Hong Kong.

61
00:03:41,072 --> 00:03:42,437
Now, that was
a misunderstanding.

62
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,072
And stole from me...

63
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,742
in my own backyard.

64
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:47,410
Now I'm stealing for you.

65
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,278
Circle of life.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
We good?

67
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:53,014
You deliver...

68
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:55,383
and yeah...

69
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,952
we're good.

70
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,322
Okay.

71
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,463
Let's get rich.

72
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:10,066
Let's.

73
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:21,043
Target lock.

74
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:23,279
Where is it?

75
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,147
Target lock.

76
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:26,481
Hey, man, uh,
just a little situation.

77
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,017
It says it's here.

78
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,452
It's supposed to be
right there,

79
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:31,294
but you know what,
let me just figure this out.

80
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,389
Target lock.

81
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,125
Somebody please kill this guy
for me.

82
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,928
Target moving.

83
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,228
No, no, no. It's here.

84
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,798
You wait, wait.
Someone else is in here.

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,399
Someone else has the capacitor.
Now, let's go. Come on.

86
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,101
Jake! Jake!

87
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:47,103
Hey, wait!

88
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,008
Son of a...

89
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,510
Go, go, go!

90
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,844
Split up.

91
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:56,846
Go!

92
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,488
Whoa!

93
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,988
Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

94
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,236
Come on! Jake!

95
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,373
Hey, boss, he went over here!

96
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,575
Go, go, go!

97
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:27,446
I see him. I see him.

98
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:33,519
This way.

99
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:45,527
Jake, Jake, Jake.

100
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,532
Nice try.

101
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,935
Yeah.

102
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,170
Jake!

103
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,974
- We're good.
- Jake!

104
00:05:58,642 --> 00:05:59,977
Jake, you son of a...

105
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:05,281
Target lock.

106
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,283
Target lock.

107
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,118
Target lock.

108
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,356
Hey! Get back here with that!

109
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:26,202
No, no!

110
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:55,231
Target moving.

111
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,089
How old are you?

112
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,757
Old enough to kick your ass.

113
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,026
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

114
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,526
Let's take a second.
Back up.

115
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,028
Back up.

116
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,597
You build this thing yourself?

117
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,132
What do you think?

118
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:38,066
I think I can sell
your little toy

119
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,502
- for a whole lot of money.
- Scrapper's not a toy

120
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,802
and she's not for sale.

121
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:42,738
The man holding the pipe
says she is.

122
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,105
So listen up...

123
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:47,609
You led them here?

124
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,710
That's impossible.

125
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,147
Hey!

126
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,084
Ah, what the hell, man?

127
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,566
Come on, come on, come on.

128
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,235
Yes.

129
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,839
It works!

130
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,474
Okay.

131
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:24,847
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

132
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,748
Get out.
What are you doing?

133
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,251
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop!
- Where is it?

134
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,485
Hey! Don't touch that. Hey.

135
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,653
What are you doing?!

136
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,854
- Stop!
- Where's the other one?

137
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:33,855
- The other what?
- The other cradle.

138
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,757
A Jaeger needs two pilots.

139
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,259
Scrapper is small enough to run
on a single neural lobe.

140
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,627
All right, then you get out,
you let me pilot.

141
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,762
Get out!

142
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:42,100
Screw that.

143
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:51,507
Told you she's not a toy.

144
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:52,675
You're gonna get us killed.

145
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:53,809
I can get us out of here.

146
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:55,213
I just got us out.

147
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,520
Oh, my God.

148
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:06,754
That's November Ajax.

149
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,657
Pilots of unregistered Jaeger,

150
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,594
this is the
Pan Pacific Defense Corps.

151
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:15,199
Power down
and exit your Conn-Pod.

152
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,235
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't-don't-don't give up.

153
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,637
You give up way too easy.

154
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:23,307
That's what they think.

155
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,252
Stop!

156
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:39,220
You are in violation
of Code Ten,

157
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,421
Section 14.

158
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:43,459
Operation of
an unregistered Jaeger.

159
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:44,893
- Hang on.
- I am hanging on!

160
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,697
Hang tighter.

161
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,477
Seriously?

162
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:02,848
Stop.

163
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,262
See?

164
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,765
I just out-piloted
November Ajax.

165
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,666
No, you didn't.

166
00:11:24,668 --> 00:11:25,668
Did.

167
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:29,706
Didn't.

168
00:11:31,676 --> 00:11:32,941
Okay. What do you got?

169
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,344
And I'm not getting out.

170
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:38,379
- One of those ion cells redundant?
- No!

171
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:39,815
- They are now.
- But we need them.

172
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:41,517
- Get up to Ajax's head.
- What?

173
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,754
Go!

174
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,800
Power down.

175
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,975
Low power warning. 12%.

176
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,344
I told you we needed that!

177
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:09,877
It worked, didn't it?

178
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,314
11%.

179
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,688
How long before Ajax
can reboot his systems?

180
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,825
About that long.

181
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,565
Power down.

182
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,303
This is your final warning.

183
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:51,887
All right, let's go.

184
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:05,667
Look what you did to my Jaeger,
you jerk!

185
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,647
Should have let me pilot.

186
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,084
Oh, like this is my fault.

187
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,052
- You compromised my command center.
- Wow.

188
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,820
Your command center?

189
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,589
- Yes. My command center.
- Wait. Sorry, sorry.

190
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:28,790
- I didn't hear that. Your command center?
- Yes!

191
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:29,791
- Wait, that sorry excuse for a command...
- And you had no

192
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,925
place to come in
and try to tell me what to do.

193
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,060
I go where I want.
It's a different world, right?

194
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,963
'Cause it really worked out
well, right? Look where

195
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,098
- we're at, right?
- Your top lip and your bottom lip,

196
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,398
they need to meet
and become friends.

197
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Smart. That's a good one.

198
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:39,734
Need to close up,
all right? Shut up.

199
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,735
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I can.

200
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,403
- Conversation done.
- Good.

201
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,939
Junkyard baby.

202
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,045
Why did you build it?

203
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:51,579
What happened
to the shutting up?

204
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,748
You said you wasn't
gonna sell it,

205
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,717
so what the hell
was you gonna do?

206
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:58,020
Rob a bank or something?

207
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:02,056
I built her because one day
they're gonna come back.

208
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,725
The Kaiju.

209
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,627
And when they do,
I'm not gonna be stuck waiting

210
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,432
for someone else
to come save my ass.

211
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,870
Not like before.

212
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:22,411
You. Let's go.

213
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:26,949
I don't really want to talk
about it. It's ridiculous.

214
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,617
That's just, like,
my right or...

215
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,166
Hello, Jake.

216
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,436
Here we are again.

217
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:51,140
It's just a stretch of
bad luck. I'll figure it out.

218
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:54,542
Father used to say
we make our own luck.

219
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,811
Yeah, well,
Dad said a lot of things.

220
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,613
You were arrested
in a rogue Jaeger.

221
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,680
Hold on a second.

222
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:01,016
That wasn't my Jaeger.

223
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,550
There's this little kid,
she's about this tall...

224
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:03,786
You have priors.

225
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:06,021
This is serious.

226
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,022
Okay.

227
00:15:07,024 --> 00:15:09,123
That's why I need my big sis

228
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,026
to help me get the hell
out of here.

229
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,994
Just one last time.

230
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,997
They're not going
to let you just walk.

231
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,999
- But there might be another way.
- Okay.

232
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,200
See, that's what I want
to hear.

233
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:21,603
That's what I'm here
to talk about, the other way.

234
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,539
Lay it on me.
What do I got to do?

235
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,140
Reenlist and finish
what you started.

236
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:26,842
I'm not doing that.

237
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,209
I'm... look, I'm-I'm too old
to be a cadet.

238
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,579
I don't want you to be a cadet.

239
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,448
I want you to help train them.

240
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,482
Train who? Train what?

241
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,782
I'm not training no damn kids.

242
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:36,517
The transport is standing by

243
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,020
to bring both of you
to Moyulan.

244
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,086
Both of us?

245
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,089
You and your new recruit.

246
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,793
Mako.

247
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,834
I can't believe
she just hologrammed me.

248
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,921
Yeah, look,
I didn't have a choice.

249
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:17,025
I know, I get it, but why me?

250
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,060
Why do they want me
for the program?

251
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,063
You built and piloted
your own Jaeger.

252
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,763
These people like
that kind of stuff.

253
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,700
Okay, so then why
am I just a cadet

254
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,801
and you get to be a ranger?

255
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,740
Valor Omega.

256
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,974
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:36,277
That, that is Valor Omega.

258
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,649
Scrapper.

259
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:44,122
Hey!

260
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,055
You got to be kidding me.

261
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,891
I didn't believe it

262
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,191
when they told me
you were inbound.

263
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:51,959
How you doing, Nate?

264
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:52,994
It's Ranger Lambert.

265
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:54,662
Are you having a laugh?

266
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:55,763
Well, this is a military base.

267
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,931
You remember how that works,

268
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,934
Ranger Pentecost.

269
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:01,002
You must be Amara Namani.

270
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,237
Yes, sir.

271
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,805
Ranger, sir.

272
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,809
Well, let's get you
squared away.

273
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,544
Oh, and, uh,

274
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:10,679
try not to steal anything
while you're here.

275
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:14,149
Did that haircut
just call you Pentecost?

276
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:17,018
As in badass Stacker Pentecost?

277
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,590
Pilot of Coyote Tango, hero
of basically the whole world?

278
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:23,057
It's just a name.

279
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,261
Yeah, a really cool name.

280
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:29,030
Sim training starts at 0600.

281
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:30,832
You're late, you miss the day.

282
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,000
You fall behind,
you'll be on the next transport

283
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,201
back to wherever
they found you.

284
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,139
That's Titan Redeemer.

285
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,107
And Bracer Phoenix.

286
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,209
She's a three-man rig.

287
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,612
Saber Athena.

288
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,912
I love Saber Athena.

289
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,315
She's the fastest Jaeger
in the fleet.

290
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,315
Did you know that?

291
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,751
Warning: stand clear of lift.

292
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:53,057
Okay, so which one's yours?

293
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:56,260
Gipsy.

294
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:03,265
- You pilot Gipsy Avenger?
- He used to

295
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,735
until his copilot got a better
offer in the private sector.

296
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,703
Jules Reyes, J-Tech.

297
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,738
Amara, cadet.

298
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,910
Jake.

299
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,109
Ranger, apparently.

300
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:15,776
Heard a lot about you,
Pentecost.

301
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,112
Yeah?

302
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:18,346
You know you still hold
the record?

303
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,815
- What record?
- Shut up.

304
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,083
So how did they lure you back?

305
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,785
I mean, it couldn't have been
the pay, so...

306
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:25,253
Oh, yeah, it's a long story,
but if you,

307
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:27,322
if you want to talk about it,
we can meet up...

308
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:30,092
She's busy.

309
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,293
Ranger.

310
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:35,963
Eyes front, Pentecost.

311
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,871
Oh! Come on, Renata,
not the face!

312
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,340
- Sorry, man. Ooh!
- Oh!

313
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,342
Ah!

314
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,978
And raise you two shower chits.

315
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,712
Fold, Ilya.

316
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,114
You need all the showers
you can get, man.

317
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,783
I have a musk!

318
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,785
What you smell is musk.

319
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:57,719
Ranger on deck!

320
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,821
Audio system deactivated.

321
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:04,125
Cadets.

322
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:06,128
This is Amara Namani.

323
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,130
She'll be joining you in
sim training bright and early.

324
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,965
And this is Ranger Pentecost.

325
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,799
He will be helping me
instruct you

326
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:15,136
until I can find a new copilot
to replace Ranger Burke.

327
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:17,439
Anything you'd like to add?

328
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:19,744
Nothing you want to hear.

329
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,846
Malikova, get Namani squared
away and prepped for training.

330
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,848
Yes, sir!

331
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,753
As you were.

332
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:34,956
Pentecost.

333
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,426
We're gonna be trained
by a Pentecost!

334
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:41,462
So? Not like he was the one who
died helping close the Breach.

335
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,899
He's never even been in combat.

336
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,901
Renata, let's go for round two.

337
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:48,804
Yo, Ilya, you see this? Ah!

338
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:50,905
Uh, hey.

339
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:53,007
So, where should I...?

340
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,442
Heard you built
your own little Jaeger.

341
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,444
Yeah, actually.

342
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:58,013
Uh, Scrapper.

343
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,181
I operated her, too,
with this solo bay...

344
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:02,484
You want to put junk together,
be a mechanic.

345
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,088
Moyulan is for pilots.

346
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,055
Hey, come on. I got ya.

347
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,725
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

348
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,860
- Um...
- Jinhai.

349
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,929
Ou-yang Jinhai.

350
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,363
So, you and Vik
already buddies, huh?

351
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,466
- Vik?
- It's short for Viktoriya.

352
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,933
But you don't want
to call her that.

353
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,835
Yeah, what's her problem?

354
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,903
- Took her three shots to pass the entrance test.
- Yeah.

355
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,271
Don't think she likes
how you landed here.

356
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,740
Yeah, well, it's not my fault.

357
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,875
Recruiters never
come around back home.

358
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:30,778
- Hey, know any Russian?
- No.

359
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll teach you some.
Calms her down.

360
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:36,517
Come on.
Let's get you squared away.

361
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,548
Aah!

362
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,851
Hemispheres out of alignment.

363
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,319
- Warning.
- We need to reconnect!

364
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,791
I know! I'm trying!

365
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,232
MAGLEV deactivated.

366
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,235
I just can't get this.

367
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:28,202
That sucked.

368
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,174
Drift simulation terminated.

369
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:34,910
You know, when I heard

370
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:37,478
you gave November Ajax
a run for his money,

371
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,114
I thought we might have
something here.

372
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:42,116
Now I'm not so sure.

373
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,251
How am I supposed to drift
in this thing?

374
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,287
It smells like feet.

375
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,055
I didn't ask for
your excuses, Cadet.

376
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:50,057
You putting her
up against Kaiju

377
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,527
that almost killed veteran
pilots doesn't make any sense.

378
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,564
Well, maybe she's not the only
one that doesn't belong here.

379
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:59,534
Wow. See, Nate, I know
you have a problem with me.

380
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:01,937
But come on.
She's just a kid.

381
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,238
So were we.
That's the point.

382
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,941
You make stronger connections
when you're young.

383
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,009
And that kind of bond makes
for a better drift pilot.

384
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,145
Yeah. I remember the pitch.

385
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,180
Thanks.

386
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:15,917
Ryoichi, Renata, you're up.

387
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,254
Show our new recruit
how it's done.

388
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:27,461
♪ I just wanna be
a better man ♪

389
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:29,363
- Oh.
- ♪ To my baby ♪

390
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:31,632
♪ Mm, mm... ♪

391
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:34,401
What the hell are you wearing?

392
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,938
Jules loves it.

393
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,440
Yeah, she told me
it's nice to finally have

394
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:41,109
someone with style around here.
Can't blame the girl.

395
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,878
- I'm sexy.
- Mm. Yeah.

396
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,017
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

397
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,218
Thanks.

398
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,952
Ice cream's up top.

399
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,323
Yes. Yes.

400
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:58,125
So, one more time around, huh?
Prove your old man wrong?

401
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,128
Nah, I just came back to see

402
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,930
if your chin implant
ever settled in.

403
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:04,065
- Well, I think it's settled in quite nicely.
- Yeah.

404
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,167
It's very commanding.
Kids must love it.

405
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,503
Jake, these kids,
they look up to us.

406
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:09,537
Mm-hmm.

407
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,040
We got to show them
that we can work together.

408
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,376
Well, the war ended
ten years ago, man.

409
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:18,279
You just need to let that go.
Just... woosah.

410
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,350
Y-You have to understand
your enemy's ob...

411
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,286
You have...

412
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,421
Sorry, mate.

413
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:28,422
You have to understand
your enemy's objective

414
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:30,057
to know you've defeated 'em.

415
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,558
- We still don't.
- No.

416
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,295
I can help you out with that.

417
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,363
See, I'm thinking it has
something to do with them

418
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:37,431
sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us.

419
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,167
No, no, no.

420
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,669
The Precursors wouldn't send
Kaiju to flatten a few cities

421
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,671
if they were trying
to wipe us all out.

422
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,972
All right, look, Nate, I don't
have a problem with you, man.

423
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,975
But I had to make a choice.

424
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,610
It was between
your pretty face and prison.

425
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,112
I chose your pretty face.

426
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:53,014
Oh, well, I'm touched.

427
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,016
And how many damn toppings
do you need?

428
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,284
Leave my toppings be, man.

429
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:57,719
Don't mess with
my damn toppings.

430
00:23:57,721 --> 00:24:01,221
So the cadets got, like, what,

431
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,623
couple of months
before they graduate?

432
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,427
- Six.
- Okay. I'll tell you what.

433
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,696
Every time you want to say
something soldiery to 'em,

434
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,699
I'll just nod, or like,
"Yep, what he said."

435
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,367
And then, before you know it,
they get to be pilots.

436
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,170
- And I get to get back to my life.
- Great.

437
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,372
Boom.

438
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,540
It may happen
sooner than you think.

439
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,076
How so?

440
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,978
Big dog and pony show tomorrow.

441
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,313
Shao and her team
are presenting

442
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:27,315
this new drone program
they have.

443
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:29,183
Could make us all obsolete.

444
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,288
Sounds like my
"get out of jail free" card.

445
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:38,093
You know, you can front
all you want,

446
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:41,031
but you and I both know
you could've been great.

447
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,162
Ms. Shao, Marshall Quan.

448
00:24:58,003 --> 00:24:59,146
It's an honor to meet you.

449
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:00,181
Sorry.

450
00:25:00,183 --> 00:25:02,450
She doesn't do
the whole hand shaking thing.

451
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:04,352
Dr. Newton Geiszler,
head of research

452
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,121
and development
for Shao Industries.

453
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:09,160
That's a nice firm,
firm grip you got there, uh...

454
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:11,122
Hand hard very shake.

455
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:13,296
Thank you for having us.

456
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:15,852
Ranger Lambert and I will
get you set up, ma'am.

457
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:23,404
That's a much better
look on you.

458
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,274
Guess it's better than
prison stripes. Barely.

459
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,276
I-I'm sorry, is this him?

460
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,277
It-It's got to be him, right?
You're Stacker's kid.

461
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,279
Hey, uh, I'm Newt.

462
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,215
I was, uh, I was a big fan
of your father's.

463
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:35,450
Amazing speech writer,
by the way.

464
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,384
Did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse?

465
00:25:37,386 --> 00:25:39,353
- Newton.
- Hermann.

466
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,822
I was hoping you'd be
tagging along.

467
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:43,357
I could use your help on
an experiment I'm working on.

468
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,293
Now, this will
only take a moment.

469
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:47,295
- I know how busy you are.
- Yeah.

470
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,264
Don't want to impose,
but, uh...

471
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:51,165
Aw, come on,
you can't impose on me.

472
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:54,436
I mean, we've been inside
each other's heads, right?

473
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:56,470
We've saved the world.

474
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,105
We've drifted with a Kaiju!

475
00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,540
You know, if we hadn't
yanked that intel

476
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:00,709
out of that Kaiju's brain,

477
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:02,776
Raleigh would've never
been able to close the Breach.

478
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,645
Now, that was you
and that was me.

479
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,648
Technically more me,

480
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,583
but any chance we could
make this quick or...?

481
00:26:08,585 --> 00:26:11,219
- Um, deployment.
- Huh?

482
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:12,453
Of Jaegers.

483
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:14,255
Deploying them into battle,
it takes, takes too much time.

484
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:15,590
The amount of damage

485
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:17,859
a Kaiju can inflict
before they've ev...

486
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:21,098
Ah, here.
I think I've found a solution.

487
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,334
Hermann, you know I can
never read your, uh...

488
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,871
Uh, rocket thrusters, huh?

489
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:32,306
Yeah. No.

490
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:34,209
No. There's no fuel
in the world

491
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:36,210
with that kind of
boost-to-mass ratio.

492
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,148
From this world.

493
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,883
No.

494
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:44,719
I-Is that Kaiju blood?

495
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:46,821
Exactly.

496
00:26:46,823 --> 00:26:49,556
I've discovered Kaiju blood
is highly reactive

497
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,293
when it's combined
with rare earth elements...

498
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:53,728
cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium.

499
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,363
I realize that, pal. Okay.

500
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,864
Y-You can't be fooling around
with this stuff.

501
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,533
You're gonna blow yourself up.
Uh...

502
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,169
Now, no one knows more about
Kaiju morphology than you.

503
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,836
- Okay.
- And if you could just take a look, please.

504
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:06,141
No, Hermann, I got to stop you.
Look, none of this matters.

505
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,775
Once my boss' drones
are approved,

506
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,710
deployment time,
that's gonna be a non-issue.

507
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,248
Within a year, buddy, we're
gonna have drones everywhere.

508
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,151
So you won't help me?

509
00:27:16,153 --> 00:27:19,187
Look, why don't we talk about
it over dinner at my place?

510
00:27:19,189 --> 00:27:20,822
Okay? You can
finally meet Alice.

511
00:27:20,824 --> 00:27:21,989
I don't need
a hot meal, Newton.

512
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,392
What I need is a solution
to a very specific problem.

513
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,927
Hey.

514
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,761
Ah, that's me, bud.

515
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:30,230
I'm sorry. Duty calls.
It's been nice catching up.

516
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,200
Newton.

517
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:33,837
I, um...

518
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:41,441
I still get nightmares
about what we saw

519
00:27:41,443 --> 00:27:44,946
when we drifted with
that disgusting Kaiju brain.

520
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:46,948
Yeah.

521
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,288
But... it was a hell
of a rush, wasn't it?

522
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,348
Dr. Geizler, time to go.

523
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,123
Okay, okay.

524
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:03,631
You and Dr. Gottleib
were close, weren't you?

525
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:04,298
During the war?

526
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,473
Oh, uh...

527
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,379
We shared lab yes okay-

528
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:10,238
Speak English, your Mandarin
makes you sound like an idiot.

529
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,538
I-I know, I'm terrible.

530
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,860
Uh, yes, we shared
a lab together.

531
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,976
What were you and Dr.
Gottlieb talking about?

532
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,978
Oh, some crazy idea
he had about

533
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,582
thruster pods
on a, on a Jaeger.

534
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:21,518
Until Secretary General Mori makes her
recommendation at the council summit,

535
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:23,078
I can't afford a misstep.

536
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,306
No more contact with him...

537
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,183
until after the vote.

538
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:30,290
Oh. Well, the man's
completely harmless. Uh...

539
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,259
Uh, okay.

540
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:36,831
Could you say that again,
and this time about 80% slower?

541
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:40,934
I said don't make me question
your loyalty. Understand?

542
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:45,405
Ay.
What's to question?

543
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,510
I... look, I barely
talk to the guy anyway.

544
00:28:47,863 --> 00:28:49,063
Then it won't be a problem.

545
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:51,234
And work on your Mandarin,

546
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:52,734
I do not like to repeat
myself.

547
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:54,282
In any language.

548
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:56,517
<i>My drones are the next step</i>

549
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,018
in Jaeger evolution.

550
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,021
The system I designed
processes commands

551
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,957
through a quantum data core.

552
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,959
This means that a single pilot

553
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:09,596
can operate the drone remotely
from anywhere in the world.

554
00:29:09,598 --> 00:29:12,700
As soon as the council
approves deployment,

555
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:16,036
based on Secretary General
Mori's final report,

556
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:18,573
the days of struggling
to find and train

557
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:22,309
drift compatible pilots
will be a thing of the past.

558
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,511
And you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us?

559
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,948
We are not here
to shut you down.

560
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,749
Cooperation between
our programs

561
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:30,517
has never been more vital.

562
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,620
If there are any questions.

563
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:35,523
Yeah, I got a question right over here!

564
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,691
We are pilots,
not a bunch of office workers!

565
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,428
And now we're shouting.
There's no need to shout.

566
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:47,434
Well, that was slick.

567
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:50,638
So, how long until all this is
shut down so I can go home?

568
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,307
I don't trust the tech.
Not yet, at least.

569
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:55,375
Well, it looks
pretty good to me.

570
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:59,013
Remote systems can be
hacked or compromised.

571
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,015
No, you've got
the key vote, right?

572
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:04,017
So there you go.
It's your decision.

573
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,388
I wish I could just
go ahead and approve them.

574
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:11,726
Nearly half the council
is backing Liwen.

575
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:14,328
They aren't going to like
my decision.

576
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,032
Who cares what they like
and what they don't like?

577
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,500
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna go with you.

578
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:21,835
For moral support.

579
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:24,037
Plus, I want to get
out of this place.

580
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm glad you offered,
because I already requested

581
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,776
Gipsy Avenger as honor guard
at the Council Summit.

582
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:31,978
Look, you know
Gipsy's Nate's ride.

583
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,915
His copilot works for
Liwen now. He needs a new one.

584
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,419
One that you already know
is drift compatible.

585
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,955
All right.

586
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:42,957
I'll do it.
I got your back.

587
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,659
But I want to be there
when you tell Nate,

588
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:45,860
'cause I just want
to see his face.

589
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:47,128
He's gonna be so pissed.

590
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,930
He's just gonna
stand there like,

591
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,431
"Yeah, I don't think
you belong in a Jaeger, Jake.

592
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,701
Get out of my Jaeger.
I'm handsome and sexy."

593
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:57,838
He is handsome.
He is sexy.

594
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,475
Thank you, Jake.

595
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,657
<i>Welcome back. Lots of sunshine</i>

596
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:18,392
<i>today to kick off our weekend.
The city...</i>

597
00:31:18,394 --> 00:31:20,928
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

598
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,596
Peter Overton broadcasting

00:31:22,598 --> 00:31:24,832

00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:26,467
<i>So far, police say</i>

00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,668
<i>at least 49 officers injured.</i>

602
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,703

606
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,113
Gipsy Avenger,
this is Marshal Quan.

607
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,017
All you have to do is stand
there and look pretty.

608
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,019
Stay focused,
try not to fall over.

609
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,421
Roger that, sir.

610
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:48,422
Go for drop.

611
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,991
In three, two, one.

612
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,993
Drop!

613
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,640
Jake!

614
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:06,807
Drift alignment unstable.

615
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:08,642
Relax.

616
00:32:08,644 --> 00:32:10,210
It's coming back to me.

617
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:12,078
- You sure?
- Ion cells activated.

618
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,048
And hey... We're in each
other's heads, remember?

619
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,451
So I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop thinking about Jules.

620
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,487
Not gonna happen.

621
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:22,155
How about you stop thinking
about kicking my ass?

622
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:23,623
Not gonna happen either.

623
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:26,497
Gonna be a long day.

624
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:28,625
Hemispheres are calibrated, sir.

625
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:32,576
Neural handshake is weak,
but holding.

626
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:38,808
Incoming transport.

627
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,614
- Warning.
- Gipsy to Command.

628
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:22,219
You reading this?

629
00:33:35,898 --> 00:33:37,664
Gipsy, this is Command.

630
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,767
Be advised,
we have a rogue Jaeger.

631
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:44,705
Pilots of unregistered Jaeger,

632
00:33:44,707 --> 00:33:47,607
power down and exit
your Conn-Pod immediately.

633
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,744
I repeat:

634
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,549
power down and exit
your Conn-Pods now.

635
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:54,849
Missiles fired!

636
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,705
Low power.

637
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:18,947
- Warning.
- We're losing power!

638
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,187
Jake! That Jaeger's

639
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:35,288
power reading is the same...

640
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:39,195
It's jamming our comms!

641
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:44,301
- Nate!
- Power's up!

642
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,727
Ah!

643
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:34,984
Oh, shit.

644
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,276
- What do we do?
- Follow my lead!

645
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:16,924
Mako's hit!

646
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:20,160
She's going down!
We've gotta move!

647
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:21,731
Activating gravity sling!

648
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:40,848
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

649
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,750
This is Mike, Mike, Charlie,
zero, five, two!

650
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:45,118
We have been hit
and we are going down!

651
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,160
- And we are going down!
- Sending.

652
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,379
- Mako!
- Jake!

653
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,684
Wait!

654
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,435
Drift alignment failing.

655
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:43,971
Come on, Sarah!

656
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,439
- Do something...
- Drift alignment failing.

657
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:47,440
...you stupid brain thing!

658
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:52,149
- Hey.
- Hey.

659
00:38:57,053 --> 00:39:00,020
So, I'm not really good

660
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:04,491
at emotional stuff, but...

661
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,830
I really am sorry
about your sister.

662
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,464
Half sister? I...

663
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:14,500
Yeah, her family died
during the Onibaba attack.

664
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:17,136
My dad took her in.

665
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:18,471
And she was my sister.

666
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:19,809
My family.

667
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:23,343
Why are you out of uniform?

668
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:28,381
Just had a lot on my mind
after Sydney.

669
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,917
Guess I just wanted
to be comfortable.

670
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,620
Well, don't let Ranger Lambert
see you in that.

671
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:35,321
He might take the stick out of
his butt and beat you with it.

672
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:36,656
I think I'm safe.

673
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,259
It's wedged in there
pretty tight.

674
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,596
So they're still using Sarah.

675
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,230
Yeah.

676
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:47,100
And I can't drift with her
for some reason.

677
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:49,937
All the other cadets
have been training for years

678
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,238
and I just...

679
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,573
I hate feeling
like the slow kid.

680
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:56,109
You gotta relax.
Or you're just grinding gears.

681
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,245
- I'll help you out.
- Got it, coach.

682
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,180
- Don't call me coach.
- All right, sensei.

683
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:02,283
Concentrate.

684
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:04,585
You have to make
a good connection.

685
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:07,490
You can't do that
if you're yappin' your gums.

686
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:13,627
You ready?

687
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,029
Ready.

688
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:17,330
All right.

689
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,168
Let's see if
we're drift compatible.

690
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,971
Get him!

691
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,613
Shoot! Come on!

692
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:35,348
Neural load exceeding limit.

693
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,085
Stay focused, Amara.

694
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:41,187
Remember,
the stronger your connection,

695
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,723
the better you fight.

696
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:45,158
That's it.

697
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:49,330
Amara! Come on, jump!
Jump to me, baby!

698
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:50,631
You have to, Amara, come on!

699
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,232
- Jump!
- Amara!

700
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:53,600
Don't hang on to the memory.

701
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:56,035
Just let it flow
right through you.

702
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,138
Amara!
Amara! Jump in there!

703
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,605
Yeah, come on.
Get together. Ready?

704
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,277
One, two, cheese!

705
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,578
Got it.

706
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,480
Want to see?

707
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,418
Wait a sec.

708
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,285
Amara.

709
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:13,988
Amara, you need to let it go.

710
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,990
Amara!

711
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:17,627
Look, just listen to my voice!

712
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:22,129
Amara!

713
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,212
- Amara!
- Daddy!

714
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:40,346
Daddy!

715
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:42,582
Amara! Come on, jump!

716
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,283
Amara!
We need to break the drift!

717
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:46,120
Jump to me! Come on!

718
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:47,353
I'm scared!

719
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,189
Baby, I will catch you,
I promise. Come on!

720
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:51,257
- Amara!
- Amara, come on!

721
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,328
Jump!

722
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:57,531
Amara!

723
00:41:57,533 --> 00:41:59,533
Take it off!

724
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:03,036
Hey.

725
00:42:03,038 --> 00:42:04,274
Are you okay?

726
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:12,546
I was there.

727
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:15,783
I felt it.

728
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:17,651
Yeah.

729
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:19,589
I felt it, too.

730
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,489
Jake, it's me.

731
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,558
You there?

732
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,460
Yeah, I'm here.

733
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:28,428
Meet me in the lab right away.
Marshal wants to see us.

734
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,430
All right.

735
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:31,064
I'm on my way.

736
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:33,232
You okay?

737
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:47,580
- What is it?
- A message. From Mako.

738
00:42:47,582 --> 00:42:49,082
She was trying
to send it from her copter

739
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:50,651
right before it went down.

740
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,852
It's a data package.
High density.

741
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:54,821
Obsidian Fury
was jamming comms.

742
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:56,355
How could her signal
get through?

743
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,524
It didn't.

744
00:42:57,526 --> 00:42:59,625
- At least not intact.
- So it's gone?

745
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,562
Well, "gone" is
relative in the digital realm.

746
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:04,131
By running a modified
fractal algorithm,

747
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:06,269
I might be able to reconstruct
a few megabytes.

748
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,474
There.

749
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:15,308
Is that a Kaiju?

750
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:19,314
I'm checking against
PPDC Kaiju archives.

751
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,718
No match against the database.

752
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,221
Keep looking.

753
00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:28,888
Whatever this is,
it was important to her.

754
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,690
I want to know why.

755
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:33,495
And I want to know who was
piloting that rogue Jaeger.

756
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:52,645
Hey.

757
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,515
Sorry I'm, uh, I-I'm late.

758
00:43:54,517 --> 00:43:55,957
I-I thought you were
still in Sydney.

759
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:59,386
The council has approved Drone deployment
in an emergency session.

760
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:00,888
Oh.

761
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,288
Uh...

762
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,790
that's great.

763
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:05,692
Thought you'd be a little
more enthusiastic, Doc.

764
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:08,395
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm pumped.
This is great.

765
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,263
Uh, it's just
the timing of everything,

766
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:11,598
with the attack and all,

767
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,232
- feels a little...
- I was there.

768
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,604
I know what happened.

769
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:18,211
And it wouldn't have...

770
00:44:18,253 --> 00:44:20,223
if our Drones had been in the field.

771
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:22,308
Neural connection terminated.

772
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:24,492
Now everyone sees that.

773
00:44:25,548 --> 00:44:26,613
Yeah.

774
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:27,850
Uh, I guess they do.

775
00:44:27,852 --> 00:44:29,871
Which means the attack was positive...

776
00:44:29,972 --> 00:44:31,572
all things considered.

777
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,689
If you look at it sideways
and you squint,

778
00:44:35,691 --> 00:44:37,290
then maybe you could say that.

779
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:38,959
Uh, I'm sorry, what are you...

780
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:40,129
what... what's going on here?

781
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:43,537
The council expects full deployment
within 48 hours.

782
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:45,602
48 is a...

783
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,180
I've worked my whole life for this.

784
00:44:47,236 --> 00:44:48,768
Get it done.

785
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,870
Okay.

786
00:44:49,872 --> 00:44:51,404
Yeah.

787
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,142
Not a problem.
That-That'll be fine.

788
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:55,184
48 hours? No way we'll be ready.

789
00:44:55,377 --> 00:44:56,643
Y-You don't think
there's a way?

790
00:44:56,645 --> 00:44:58,411
All right, well,
then you're fired.

791
00:44:58,413 --> 00:44:59,513
Okay? How about that?

792
00:44:59,515 --> 00:45:01,381
Or maybe you're promoted.

793
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:02,448
I don't know.
We'll see how it goes.

794
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,450
Just get it done!

795
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:06,285
Give me this.

796
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:27,373
Hey, honey!

797
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,942
I'm home!

798
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:29,942
Sorry I'm late.

799
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,511
God, things were...

800
00:45:32,513 --> 00:45:35,281
things were crazy today,
with what happened in Sydney.

801
00:45:35,283 --> 00:45:37,584
♪ This
mountain I must climb... ♪

802
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:40,821
All those people...
it was, uh, not pretty.

803
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:41,989
My boss almost got killed.

804
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,422
That could've been bad.

805
00:45:43,424 --> 00:45:45,292
Maybe.
I guess, I don't know.

806
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:47,294
That would've been great,
actually,

807
00:45:47,296 --> 00:45:48,661
that one is all over me.

808
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,964
I mean, I can't get
a break from her!

809
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:52,933
I'm ranting.
Enough about work.

810
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:55,502
And enough about her, really,
I should be focused on you.

811
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:59,439
How about we have
a little fun in the bedroom?

812
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:00,774
How was your day?

813
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:04,544
Oh. That's great.

814
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:07,480
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's exciting.

815
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:08,714
What's that?

816
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:11,785
A little pick-me-up?

817
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:13,786
Well...

818
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:16,989
...what can I say?

819
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,859
You read my mind.

820
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,527
♪ I want to know what love is ♪

821
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:22,995
♪ Oh, oh ♪

822
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:26,065
♪ I want you to show me. ♪

823
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:28,000
Hundreds of police officers...

824
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:30,370
They're calling it
Obsidian Fury.

825
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:31,805
There's never been a rogue
like this.

826
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:32,872
News feed said

827
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,940
they were posting a dozen
Jaegers at the memorial.

828
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:36,810
When I die, I want that many
to send me off.

829
00:46:36,812 --> 00:46:39,578
Your pop's gonna make you work
with boobs when you wash out.

830
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,082
Jaegers do not show up
when the boob guy dies.

831
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:43,283
Wait, your dad
works with boobs?

832
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:46,652
He's a plastic surgeon.
He doesn't just work with...

833
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:47,988
I'm not gonna wash out.

834
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,089
I'm gonna be a pilot.

835
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:50,524
Still. You die,

836
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:52,625
meh, I post one Jaeger
at your funeral.

837
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,828
Maybe half a Jaeger.

838
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,031
I heard that's where
they found Amara.

839
00:46:58,033 --> 00:46:59,732
In half a Jaeger.

840
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:01,600
It was a whole Jaeger.

841
00:47:01,602 --> 00:47:05,642
It just wasn't very big,
Viktoriya.

842
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:11,044
Bigger is better.

843
00:47:15,817 --> 00:47:17,919
What did you say?

844
00:47:19,787 --> 00:47:20,953
Am I saying that right?

845
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:22,788
Yep.

846
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,989
- Ah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

847
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,692
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Guys.

848
00:47:25,694 --> 00:47:26,993
I worked every day of my life
to be here.

849
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:28,093
You didn't do anything.

850
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,029
You were just picked up
off the street like garbage!

851
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:31,598
Guys, come on!

852
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,866
Hey, hey.

853
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:36,902
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You know where I learned that?

854
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:38,805
On the streets,
you big, dumb...

855
00:47:38,807 --> 00:47:39,908
Ranger on deck!

856
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,477
She jumped me!

857
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:44,745
She doesn't belong here!

858
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:45,815
I don't care!

859
00:47:47,915 --> 00:47:51,651
You know, when I first joined
the Corps, I was just like you.

860
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:54,823
Worse. I was nobody.

861
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:58,725
But that woman
we laid to rest today,

862
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:02,962
Mako Mori, she said,
"Whoever you are,

863
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,931
"the minute you enter this
program, you join a family.

864
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:07,634
"And no matter what they do,

865
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:10,940
no matter how stupid
they may act sometimes..."

866
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:15,510
"...you forgive 'em
and you move on."

867
00:48:17,044 --> 00:48:21,948
So you start believing that.
In here.

868
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,651
And you'll start believing
in a Jaeger.

869
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,018
Hey.

870
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,422
Marshal's looking for you guys.

871
00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:30,426
Says Gottlieb found something.

872
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:34,127
It isn't something.

873
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:35,594
It's somewhere.

874
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:38,031
Severnaya Zemlya.

875
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:40,033
Off Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula.

876
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:40,834
What's in Zemlya?

877
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,636
Well, nothing anymore.

878
00:48:42,638 --> 00:48:44,703
A facility roughly
in this location

879
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:47,674
was used to manufacture Jaeger
power cores earlier in the war.

880
00:48:47,676 --> 00:48:50,210
- But it was decommissioned years ago.
- Why would

881
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:52,446
Mako be trying to tell us
about an abandoned factory

882
00:48:52,448 --> 00:48:54,448
in the middle of nowhere?

883
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,216
Sir, permission
to take Gipsy Avenger

884
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,454
to see what the hell's
out there.

885
00:49:28,517 --> 00:49:30,216
Scanning.

886
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:34,187
Looks like
Mako's message was a dead end.

887
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:36,489
This place is abandoned.

888
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:39,058
No, no, wait a second.

889
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,960
I'm getting
some weird readings.

890
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:43,432
Incoming!

891
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:01,551
Take out his legs!

892
00:50:37,886 --> 00:50:39,585
We got to get out of here!

893
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:16,057
Plasma cannon!

894
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:26,801
- Think we pissed him off.
- Good.

895
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:34,306
You remember our old move?

896
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:35,611
Hell yeah.

897
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:49,788
He looks hurt!

898
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,959
Go for his power core!

899
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,200
Ah!

900
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:12,814
Warning.

901
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:42,375
Pilots of Obsidian Fury,

902
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:43,980
get the hell out
of your Conn-Pod!

903
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,192
What the hell is that?

904
00:53:03,732 --> 00:53:07,033
It's definitely Kaiju.

905
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:09,301
A secondary brain used to
control the hindquarters.

906
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:11,171
How'd they get into our world?

907
00:53:11,173 --> 00:53:12,739
There hasn't been a breach
in ten years.

908
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,040
Sensors would've picked it up.

909
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,942
I don't think
there was a breach.

910
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:17,377
Kaiju flesh...

911
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:20,180
has a distinct radioactive
half-life signature.

912
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:21,881
Particular to the Anteverse.

913
00:53:21,883 --> 00:53:24,783
This specimen does not.

914
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,120
Wait, so, you're-you're saying
that it's from our universe?

915
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,256
The genetic fingerprints
indicate distinctly terrestrial

916
00:53:31,258 --> 00:53:33,093
modification techniques,
probably engineered

917
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:35,728
from Kaiju flesh left over
from the war.

918
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,799
Precursors didn't do this.

919
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:41,102
Humans did.

920
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:47,105
Oh, my God.

921
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:50,009
That hunk of slimy crap
was piloting Obsidian Fury?

922
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:51,511
We got to get a look inside.

923
00:53:51,513 --> 00:53:52,745
Inside?

924
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:55,147
That thing's part Kaiju.

925
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,750
Come on, guys. When are we
ever gonna get a chance

926
00:53:57,752 --> 00:53:59,051
to see something
like this again?

927
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:00,053
Never.

928
00:54:00,055 --> 00:54:01,888
Never would be good.

929
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,156
You guys can stay here.

930
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:04,457
I'm going.

931
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:06,091
No, Amar... Amara.

932
00:54:06,093 --> 00:54:10,163
Guys, guys,
we should not be in here.

933
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,437
Whoa.

934
00:54:16,971 --> 00:54:20,038
It's fused all the way
through the system.

935
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,277
Like... muscle tissue.

936
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:28,413
That's how it was able
to move like it did.

937
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,917
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

938
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:34,788
Working with boobs is sounding
better and better.

939
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,457
Shine your light over here.

940
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:40,493
Oh, yeah, let's just
go yank on the guts

941
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:42,131
of the weird-ass Kaiju killbot.

942
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:46,832
What is it?

943
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,535
I think it's some sort of...

944
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:49,902
Jinhai!

945
00:54:49,904 --> 00:54:51,571
I told you
not to yank on those.

946
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:53,872
Go get help! Go!

947
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,341
Man, we are so screwed!

948
00:54:55,343 --> 00:54:57,544
This goes way past
what she did.

949
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:59,111
The decision has been made.

950
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:00,446
Security will take it
from here.

951
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:02,118
We're done!

952
00:55:07,823 --> 00:55:09,922
Is Jinhai okay?

953
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:11,957
He's got some scarring,
but yeah, he'll live.

954
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,292
Marshal put him on probation.

955
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:15,060
Meilin and Suresh, too.

956
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,361
They blink wrong,
all of 'em are out.

957
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:18,031
No, it's not their fault.

958
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:19,464
- I talked them into it.
- I'm sorry, I tried to talk

959
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:20,299
to the marshal, but...

960
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:22,772
you're dismissed
from the program.

961
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,272
Never belonged here anyway.

962
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:28,875
Really?

963
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:32,377
You know, I used to say
the same thing a long time ago.

964
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:36,281
But I actually didn't
want to be here.

965
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:38,116
Still don't.

966
00:55:38,118 --> 00:55:39,919
Why'd you sign up?

967
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:42,355
We were at war.

968
00:55:42,357 --> 00:55:44,290
And my dad
was leading the charge

969
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:47,125
and I thought...
maybe I could see more of him.

970
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,864
Maybe even drift with him.

971
00:55:50,866 --> 00:55:52,866
Well, one night,
me and Nate got into it.

972
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:55,968
It was over something stupid.
I can't even remember what.

973
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,937
So I climbed in an old Mark 4

974
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,640
just to show him I didn't
need him to be a great pilot.

975
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:03,576
That's pretty dumb.

976
00:56:03,578 --> 00:56:06,011
- Yeah.
- How far'd you get?

977
00:56:06,013 --> 00:56:09,281
- About seven steps, well, take or leave.
- How far did you get?

978
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,216
About two steps, then
I blacked out from the strain.

979
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:14,921
And the first thing I saw
when I woke up was my dad,

980
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:17,556
just standing right
in front of me, looking stern.

981
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,893
Wh-What'd he say?

982
00:56:19,895 --> 00:56:21,393
He said I was
out of the program.

983
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:23,462
He said I didn't deserve
to be in a Jaeger.

984
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,200
Look, he said a lot of things.

985
00:56:27,269 --> 00:56:30,203
A year later, my dad was gone.

986
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:32,672
And I didn't get a chance
to prove him wrong.

987
00:56:32,674 --> 00:56:37,609
More importantly, I didn't get
a chance to prove it to myself.

988
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,379
You listen to me.

989
00:56:39,381 --> 00:56:41,114
Don't let what other people
think of you

990
00:56:41,116 --> 00:56:43,448
define who you are.

991
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,484
You won't like
where that takes you.

992
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,222
Do you understand?

993
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,625
And keep your head up.

994
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,527
And you might just be
as good-looking as me

995
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:56,696
in this type of situation.

996
00:56:56,698 --> 00:56:58,330
Seriously.

997
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,033
This face is, is set up well.

998
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:03,438
Beauty is a burden.

999
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,077
You'll be all right.

1000
00:57:11,479 --> 00:57:14,614
Shao Industries.

1001
00:57:14,616 --> 00:57:16,281
What?

1002
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:20,620
Obsidian Fury has tech in it
made by Shao Industries.

1003
00:57:20,622 --> 00:57:23,089
That's impossible.
Jules and her team

1004
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:24,489
scanned every centimeter
of that Jaeger.

1005
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:27,326
Insulating metamaterials
wound counterclockwise

1006
00:57:27,328 --> 00:57:29,962
in the shunt cabling.

1007
00:57:29,964 --> 00:57:32,165
Shao's the only company
that winds them that way.

1008
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:34,634
Amara, are you sure about what
you're telling me right now?

1009
00:57:34,636 --> 00:57:36,468
Yes.

1010
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,004
Yeah.

1011
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:40,942
I stole a ton to make Scrapper.

1012
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:44,576
I thought
it might be important.

1013
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:47,480
Yeah.

1014
00:57:47,482 --> 00:57:49,181
Thank you.

1015
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:50,616
<i>Shao Industries?</i>

1016
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:52,986
They don't even have
a bio division.

1017
00:57:52,988 --> 00:57:54,620
Yeah, not that we know of.

1018
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:57,290
Cabling could have been stolen,
just like in Amara's Jaeger.

1019
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:59,524
We're gonna need more than that
to connect Fury to Shao.

1020
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:00,993
What about Newt?

1021
00:58:00,995 --> 00:58:02,562
He'd have access
to the internal records,

1022
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,696
- the shipping manifests...
- All right.

1023
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:06,198
Go see him.
Keep a low profile.

1024
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,002
I have a mission?
Finally.

1025
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:11,240
We'll take what we know
to the marshal.

1026
00:58:23,274 --> 00:58:25,778
The building is secure, ma'am.

1027
00:58:26,146 --> 00:58:28,981
No visitors without the proper credentials.

1028
00:58:29,018 --> 00:58:31,182
I don't want anyone interfering
with deployment.

1029
00:58:33,994 --> 00:58:35,987
What is it?

1030
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,067
I'll be in my office.

1031
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:40,005
Okay.

1032
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:46,741
This isn't fair.

1033
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:51,143
I'm sorry.

1034
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:53,046
You don't deserve this.

1035
00:58:53,048 --> 00:58:56,415
It was my fault.

1036
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:59,988
This is on me.

1037
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:12,497
Amara.

1038
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:15,667
The next Jaeger you build...

1039
00:59:15,669 --> 00:59:17,740
make it a big one.

1040
00:59:28,716 --> 00:59:31,250
System online.

1041
00:59:31,252 --> 00:59:35,221
And we have delivery
at 100%, people.

1042
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:37,122
- System online.
- A hundred percent!

1043
00:59:37,124 --> 00:59:39,125
That's the way
that it's done, okay?

1044
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:41,227
I told you we could do it, and we did it!

1045
00:59:41,229 --> 00:59:42,227
Malfunction.

1046
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:44,230
I'm losing uplink to drone 375!

1047
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:45,165
- Why?
- Malfunction.

1048
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,732
Why? Figure out why!

1049
00:59:47,734 --> 00:59:49,868
We'll take what we know
to the council in person.

1050
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,539
Prep a transport.

1051
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:54,810
Give me a second.

1052
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:56,925
The Drones in the field are malfunctioning!

1053
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,688
Stop the ones coming in from deploying!

1054
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:08,757
Get to Gipsy! Go!

1055
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:22,167
All pilots,

1056
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:24,105
man your Jaegers
and engage hostiles!

1057
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:41,687
Okay, you got this.
You cool?

1058
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,885
Yeah, super cool.
Just, uh, just stay calm.

1059
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:45,614
Doctor Geiszler! Shao's looking for you?

1060
01:00:45,616 --> 01:00:46,625
I-I know. I'm heading up!
I'm heading right...

1061
01:00:46,627 --> 01:00:48,794
Hermann.

1062
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:51,596
Uh, what are you doing here?
How'd you get in here?

1063
01:00:51,598 --> 01:00:53,332
I do have PPDC credentials,
and besides,

1064
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:54,767
everyone else seems
a little bit preoccupied

1065
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:56,705
with the killer drones
your boss just set off!

1066
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:28,466
- She used you.
- No.

1067
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:30,870
- She lured you with money and a fancy title.
- No. No way.

1068
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:32,738
And while you were
basking in the glow,

1069
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,940
she took your research
and she twisted it.

1070
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:37,343
Help me stop her, Newton.

1071
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:39,312
Help me save the world
like old times.

1072
01:01:39,314 --> 01:01:41,547
All right, technically, uh,
you were helping me last time.

1073
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:43,716
- Let's get that straight.
- Fine.

1074
01:01:43,718 --> 01:01:45,551
Help me help you
save the world.

1075
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:46,819
What do you say?

1076
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:49,388
Well, I say, um, I say...
Don't shoot!

1077
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,623
Uh...

1078
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:54,229
Goddamn it!
Why can't I get this language?

1079
01:01:57,397 --> 01:01:59,899
- What's happening?!
- Amara! Are those Jaegers?

1080
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:00,899
No, they're drones
from Shao Industries.

1081
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:02,567
What are they doing?

1082
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:03,636
I don't know.
They just went crazy.

1083
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:05,870
Hey! Clear the deck now!

1084
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,808
Get back to your quarters
right now!

1085
01:02:10,712 --> 01:02:12,214
- Yes, sir! Go, go, go!
- Go! Go!

1086
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:19,484
Go! Get the hell out of here!
Come on!

1087
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,685
Come on.

1088
01:02:20,687 --> 01:02:21,956
Come on, come on.
Get up.

1089
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,402
Really? Now?

1090
01:02:53,654 --> 01:02:56,489
Hermann! A little help!

1091
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:58,024
Next time, why don't you learn

1092
01:02:58,026 --> 01:02:59,859
how to use a gun!
Take that!

1093
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,861
Vile, vile individual!

1094
01:03:03,397 --> 01:03:04,930
- Thank you, Newton.
- Yeah.

1095
01:03:04,932 --> 01:03:06,866
I'd hug you if I didn't
have a rule about

1096
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:08,033
- public displays of affection.
- It's fine.

1097
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,669
- Oh, to hell with it.
- Okay. All right.

1098
01:03:09,671 --> 01:03:10,569
If you're done groping me,

1099
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:11,870
let's take care
of the drones, right?

1100
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:12,872
- Mm.
- Okay.

1101
01:03:14,644 --> 01:03:16,475
Shut down all systems! Now!

1102
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:18,910
Everyone, get out of the lab
or I will shoot you!

1103
01:03:18,912 --> 01:03:20,014
I will shoot you twice!

1104
01:03:20,016 --> 01:03:22,580
- Always knew you'd go nuts!
- You're officially fired. Get out.

1105
01:03:22,582 --> 01:03:24,884
What do we do?
How do we stop this?

1106
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:26,919
- There's a back door, Hermann.
- To what?

1107
01:03:26,921 --> 01:03:28,788
To the drone subroutine.

1108
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,890
I added a subroutine just
in case I want to get in here

1109
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,993
- and poke around down the road.
- Oh, sneaky bastard.

1110
01:03:33,995 --> 01:03:36,999
I know, right?

1111
01:03:41,102 --> 01:03:44,002
What did you just do?

1112
01:03:44,004 --> 01:03:46,674
What I've been planning
the last ten years.

1113
01:03:48,776 --> 01:03:50,645
I'm ending the world.

1114
01:04:20,653 --> 01:04:22,388
Where the hell are my pilots?!

1115
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,358
Sitrep!

1116
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,692
Breaches detected, multiple locations!

1117
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,887
It's the Drones, sir!

1118
01:04:27,548 --> 01:04:30,049
All pilots, breaches detected.

1119
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:32,118
Drones in the field
are opening multiple breaches

1120
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,555
across the Pacific Rim.

1121
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:47,031
Why?

1122
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,834
Why would you do this?

1123
01:04:48,836 --> 01:04:50,835
Why would I do this? Mm.

1124
01:04:50,837 --> 01:04:53,772
Well, I guess I wouldn't.

1125
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:55,707
Well, not normally,
not really my style.

1126
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:58,877
Yeah, no, I don't know, maybe
I hate you all for treating me

1127
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,645
like an insignificant
little joke of a man.

1128
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:03,716
Maybe that's why he did it,
Hermann... I did it.

1129
01:05:03,718 --> 01:05:05,417
Uh, see.

1130
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:08,356
There you go.
There's the problem.

1131
01:05:10,457 --> 01:05:14,426
I'm just not feeling
totally myself these days.

1132
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:16,365
You.

1133
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:23,838
Precursors.

1134
01:05:26,573 --> 01:05:28,908
Very good, Hermann,
you figured it out.

1135
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:31,810
And as usual, a step behind.

1136
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:34,680
Newton. You are a good man.

1137
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,549
- No. Uh, Hermann.
- You must stop.

1138
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:37,750
No, there's no point
in fighting them.

1139
01:05:37,752 --> 01:05:39,618
- You must fight back.
- I'm not strong enough, Hermann.

1140
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,152
- Please, Newton. You must!
- I am not strong enough.

1141
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:43,656
He is not strong enough!

1142
01:05:43,658 --> 01:05:46,560
None of you are strong enough!

1143
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,634
I'm sorry, Hermann.

1144
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:56,504
They're in my head.

1145
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:58,513
Let him go!

1146
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:00,385
You're not going to ruin my life's work.

1147
01:06:00,841 --> 01:06:02,176
Oh, hey, boss.

1148
01:06:11,618 --> 01:06:13,555
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

1149
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:17,957
What the hell
are you doing here?

1150
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:20,759
- I told you to get to quarters!
- All the doors are blocked!

1151
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:21,761
What do we do?!

1152
01:06:21,996 --> 01:06:24,296
How did you do it without me knowing?

1153
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:28,667
I mean, 38% of your company
is fully automated.

1154
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:31,770
It really wasn't very hard to
reallocate a little over here

1155
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:33,772
and a little over there,

1156
01:06:33,774 --> 01:06:36,014
and slip in a little Kaiju
surprise without you noticing.

1157
01:06:36,626 --> 01:06:40,031
Especially since you always thought...

1158
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:42,636
you were the smartest person in the room.

1159
01:06:42,638 --> 01:06:44,504
In about a second, I'm going to be.

1160
01:06:44,551 --> 01:06:46,051
Stop! Wait, wait, wait!

1161
01:06:46,053 --> 01:06:48,286
Newt's not in control
of himself!

1162
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:49,989
It isn't him!
It's the Precursors.

1163
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:51,089
They must have infected
his mind

1164
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,091
when we drifted with the Kaiju.

1165
01:06:52,093 --> 01:06:53,761
Shut up!

1166
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,994
Security, find and detain Dr. Geiszler.

1167
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,795
If he tries to resist,
put a bullet in his head.

1168
01:06:57,797 --> 01:07:00,000
You stay here. We're gonna
try and get to Gipsy.

1169
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:03,902
You ready for this?

1170
01:07:03,904 --> 01:07:05,837
- No. You?
- No.

1171
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,172
- On three.
- Great.

1172
01:07:07,174 --> 01:07:08,741
One, two...

1173
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:10,609
Hello? Anyone there?

1174
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:11,877
Gottlieb?

1175
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:13,846
Jake! Thank God.

1176
01:07:13,848 --> 01:07:15,915
We're under attack!
You need to force Liwen

1177
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,616
- to shut down the drones!
- It isn't her.

1178
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:19,618
It isn't Liwen.
It-it was Newt.

1179
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,886
The Precursors,
they've infected him.

1180
01:07:21,888 --> 01:07:23,556
They're controlling his mind.

1181
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:25,857
Gottlieb, can you get him
to disable the drones?

1182
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:27,259
No. He got away.

1183
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:33,835
Gottlieb, shut 'em down.

1184
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,340
I've penetrated the subroutine.

1185
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,837
It-It's trying to lock you out.

1186
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:40,105
Feedback loop.

1187
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,049
Gottlieb,
what the hell is going on?

1188
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:53,287
Gottlieb!

1189
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:14,739
Gottlieb, shut 'em down
or we're gonna die!

1190
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:18,012
Shut 'em down!

1191
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:30,155
Yes!

1192
01:08:58,351 --> 01:09:00,085
Liwen has disabled the drones.

1193
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:01,886
The breaches are closed.

1194
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,721
I repeat,
the breaches are closed.

1195
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:09,060
Oh, no.

1196
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,895
"Oh, no" what?

1197
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,730
Three Kaiju
have gotten through.

1198
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,167
South Korea, Russian coast,
and East China Sea.

1199
01:09:16,169 --> 01:09:18,703
Two Cat 4s and a Cat 5.

1200
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:20,104
Copy that.

1201
01:09:20,106 --> 01:09:22,006
Get back to the dome.

1202
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:24,145
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

1203
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:28,746
You girls okay?

1204
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,850
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

1205
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:39,058
All right, what do we got?

1206
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,292
The reports are
still coming in,

1207
01:09:40,294 --> 01:09:42,694
but drones took out Jaegers and
Shatterdomes across the Rim.

1208
01:09:42,696 --> 01:09:43,895
All right. How many Jaegers
do we have here?

1209
01:09:43,897 --> 01:09:44,964
Operational?
Gipsy Avenger, barely.

1210
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:47,800
- That's it? - Yeah.
- Okay. We need more Jaegers

1211
01:09:47,802 --> 01:09:49,934
up and running or this is
gonna be a short fight.

1212
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,403
Even if we can,
all of our other pilots

1213
01:09:51,405 --> 01:09:52,470
are either dead
or severely injured.

1214
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:54,005
Okay, okay,
one disaster at a time.

1215
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:55,327
Let's just focus
on those Jaegers.

1216
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:59,247
Smallie, come over here.

1217
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:04,882
I need you to help Jules
with the repairs.

1218
01:10:04,884 --> 01:10:07,885
- Can you do that?
- I thought I was kicked out.

1219
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:09,888
I'm kicking you back in.

1220
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:12,123
She's pretty good
at turning junk into Jaegers.

1221
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,827
You good with that?

1222
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:17,729
- Hell yeah.
- Right, we got a lot of work to do

1223
01:10:17,731 --> 01:10:20,733
and not a lot of time.

1224
01:10:20,735 --> 01:10:22,003
We got incoming!

1225
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:49,763
I brought some help!

1226
01:10:54,802 --> 01:10:58,937
Hakuja, Shrikethorn,
and the big fella, Raijin.

1227
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:01,873
I took the liberty of
assigning the designations.

1228
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:03,375
Well, the spiky guy
and the big idiot

1229
01:11:03,377 --> 01:11:05,376
are moving away from the cities
and towards the ocean.

1230
01:11:05,378 --> 01:11:07,379
- What does that mean?
- Maybe they're trying

1231
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:10,381
to link up with Hakuja
in the East China Sea.

1232
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:12,885
Yeah, I bet Newt would know
what they're up to,

1233
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,886
if we can get it out of him.

1234
01:11:14,888 --> 01:11:17,458
Yeah, we'd have
to find him first.

1235
01:11:19,058 --> 01:11:21,160
Any Jaegers closer
to those Kaiju than us?

1236
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:23,127
What was left of the Chin-do
and the Sakhalinsk domes

1237
01:11:23,129 --> 01:11:25,397
tried to intercept...
emphasis on "tried."

1238
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:26,831
I'm afraid we're on our own.

1239
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,834
There's got to be
something here.

1240
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:30,903
Something in
the East China Sea.

1241
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:33,237
Maybe that's not
where they're headed.

1242
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:36,175
Pull up a map of
Kaiju movement from the war.

1243
01:11:36,177 --> 01:11:37,943
Pushing data to main display.

1244
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:41,145
What, do you know
something we don't?

1245
01:11:41,147 --> 01:11:43,314
You said we need to understand
our enemy's objective

1246
01:11:43,316 --> 01:11:45,818
to know we've beaten them.

1247
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:47,819
What if the Kaiju
weren't blindly attacking

1248
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:48,953
our cities during the war?

1249
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:50,859
What if we were
just in their way?

1250
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:56,161
Well, right here.

1251
01:11:56,163 --> 01:11:58,330
Mount Fuji, Japan.

1252
01:11:58,332 --> 01:12:00,301
Extrapolate for Hakuja,
Shrikethorn and Raijin.

1253
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:07,005
Mount Fuji? But why?

1254
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:10,442
- Rare earth elements.
- Huh?

1255
01:12:10,444 --> 01:12:15,947
Mount Fuji is a volcano
rich in rare earth elements.

1256
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:17,849
Kaiju blood reacts
extremely violently

1257
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:19,952
with rare earth elements
is the basis of

1258
01:12:19,954 --> 01:12:21,620
my fuel-thruster experiments.
Excuse me.

1259
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:22,854
Oh, that sounds bad.
That's bad, right?

1260
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:26,925
Very. Mount Fuji's active,
a geological pressure point.

1261
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,228
Based on the blood-to-mass
ratio of the Kaiju,

1262
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,130
the reaction would cause
a cascade event,

1263
01:12:32,132 --> 01:12:36,001
igniting the Ring of Fire
around the Pacific Rim.

1264
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:39,270
Billions of tons
of toxic gas and ash

1265
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:43,242
will spew into the atmosphere,
wiping out all life.

1266
01:12:43,244 --> 01:12:46,310
And finish terraforming
the Earth for the Precursors.

1267
01:12:46,312 --> 01:12:48,412
We can't let 'em
reach Mount Fuji.

1268
01:12:48,414 --> 01:12:50,415
I'm gonna check with Jules
for Jaeger repairs.

1269
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:52,251
Even if we had
a hundred Jaegers,

1270
01:12:52,253 --> 01:12:54,019
there's no way
to intercept in time.

1271
01:12:54,021 --> 01:12:56,487
- What about your thruster pods?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1272
01:12:56,489 --> 01:12:58,090
They're not, they're not ready.

1273
01:12:58,092 --> 01:13:00,291
- Can they be?
- Well, in theory,

1274
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:03,028
if it, um...
maybe, with-with your help.

1275
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:05,066
Gottlieb, what does that mean,
"in theory"?

1276
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,468
Today...

1277
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:12,170
it means yes!

1278
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:57,416
Power partially
restored in sectors two...

1279
01:13:57,418 --> 01:13:59,684
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo,
and Bracer Phoenix

1280
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:00,719
are good to go.

1281
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:02,321
It's not a lot to work with.

1282
01:14:02,323 --> 01:14:04,055
If Liwen can patch
some Fury tech into Gipsy,

1283
01:14:04,057 --> 01:14:05,090
that might help.

1284
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:06,390
Okay.

1285
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:08,626
- Prep everything we got for deployment.
- Okay.

1286
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:10,899
Don't get yourself killed.

1287
01:14:13,132 --> 01:14:15,068
You either.

1288
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,042
Well, that's confusing.

1289
01:14:25,012 --> 01:14:26,678
Let's just stay focused.

1290
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,148
We got four Jaegers against
two Category 4s and a Fiver.

1291
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,582
It's better than just Gipsy.

1292
01:14:31,584 --> 01:14:33,751
We still need pilots.

1293
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:35,754
We have 'em.

1294
01:14:35,756 --> 01:14:36,990
Oh, shit.

1295
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:57,642
If my dad was here, he'd
probably give you a big speech.

1296
01:14:57,644 --> 01:14:59,480
Make you feel invincible.

1297
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:05,416
I'm not my father.

1298
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,519
I'm not a hero like he was.

1299
01:15:08,521 --> 01:15:13,257
Like Raleigh Becket
and Mako Mori.

1300
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:16,661
But they didn't start out
that way.

1301
01:15:16,663 --> 01:15:20,364
They started out as cadets,
just like you.

1302
01:15:20,366 --> 01:15:23,801
We remember them as giants
because they stood tall.

1303
01:15:23,803 --> 01:15:25,138
Because they stood together.

1304
01:15:26,573 --> 01:15:28,206
It doesn't matter
who your parents are,

1305
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:30,242
where you came from,

1306
01:15:30,244 --> 01:15:31,542
who believed in you
and who didn't.

1307
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:34,278
We are a family now.

1308
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,447
And we are Earth's
last defense.

1309
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:40,551
This is our time, this is our
chance to make a difference.

1310
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:43,522
Now let's mount up
and get it done!

1311
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:45,256
Do you understand?

1312
01:15:45,258 --> 01:15:46,457
Yes, sir!

1313
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,460
Jaeger pilots,
do you understand?!

1314
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:49,693
Yes, sir!

1315
01:15:49,695 --> 01:15:51,630
- Do you understand?!
- Yes, sir!

1316
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:54,398
Now help me save the world.

1317
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,068
Let's do this.

1318
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:03,274
- System online.
- Initiating neural handshake.

1319
01:16:03,276 --> 01:16:05,743
Establishing neural link.

1320
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:07,614
Amara, jump in there!

1321
01:16:09,682 --> 01:16:13,452
- Neural handshake strong and steady.
- So...

1322
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:16,854
how does it feel
to be in a real Jaeger?

1323
01:16:16,856 --> 01:16:19,224
- Bigger's not bad.
- All right,

1324
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:21,792
all Jaegers sound off.
Go-no-go for launch.

1325
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:24,129
Guardian Bravo, go.

1326
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:25,729
Saber Athena, go.

1327
01:16:25,731 --> 01:16:28,332
Bracer Phoenix,
let's go already.

1328
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,501
Copy that.

1329
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,804
Command, we are go for launch.

1330
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,340
Roger, Gipsy Avenger.

1331
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:38,343
Ignition in ten seconds.

1332
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,678
Nine,

01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,545
eight,

01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:43,881

five, four,

1336
01:16:46,854 --> 01:16:49,153
three, two,

1337
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:50,421
one.

1338
01:16:50,423 --> 01:16:51,758
Ignition!

1339
01:17:16,482 --> 01:17:17,782
Warning.

1340
01:17:17,784 --> 01:17:20,751
Exceeding structural limits.

1341

♪ Tro-lo-lo-lo-lo,
lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo... ♪

1343
01:17:36,436 --> 01:17:38,569
My grandmother used
to play it for me.

1344
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,639
- Keeps me calm.
- What about me?

1345
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:43,175

Gipsy to Command.
Targets acquired.

1350
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:18,269
Roger that, Gipsy.

1351
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,336
Everyone in the city is secured

1352
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,505
in underground shelters.

1353
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:22,439
You are clear to engage.

1354
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:24,408
Solid copy. Going hot.
Bracer Phoenix, on me.

1355
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:25,510
We'll take Raijin.

1356
01:19:25,512 --> 01:19:26,544
Roger that, Gipsy.

1357
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:28,345
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo,

1358
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:30,415
- you take the other two.
- Copy that.

1359
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,317
It's our turn
to save the world.

1360
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:33,984
- Let's hope so.
- On my mark.

1361
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,754
Three, two,

1362
01:19:35,756 --> 01:19:37,490
one, mark!

1363
01:20:25,338 --> 01:20:26,338
Fire!

1364
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:43,420
Gipsy, Raijin's faceplates

1365
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:44,723
are absorbing the hits
and throwing the energy

1366
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:45,889
back at you!

1367
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:47,294
Let's see it absorb this.

1368
01:21:03,008 --> 01:21:06,411
How many buildings
can this thing take?!

1369
01:21:29,569 --> 01:21:30,835
Shrikethorn inbound!

1370
01:21:30,837 --> 01:21:33,438
Hey, guys, we could use
a little help over here!

1371
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,407
- Right now!
- Copy that, Saber.

1372
01:21:36,409 --> 01:21:38,475
Vik, take out Shrikethorn.

1373
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:39,946
On it.

1374
01:21:52,758 --> 01:21:55,126
Saber Athena, Guardian Bravo
coming to assist!

1375
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:57,598
Activating arc whip!

1376
01:22:13,946 --> 01:22:16,214
Yeah, that's right!

1377
01:22:16,216 --> 01:22:17,648
You better run!

1378
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:19,486
These things ain't that tough.

1379
01:22:29,796 --> 01:22:31,895
Bracer Phoenix, watch your six!

1380
01:22:31,897 --> 01:22:33,031
Hostile inbound!

1381
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:34,198
Copy that!

1382
01:22:40,073 --> 01:22:41,605
Yeah!

1383
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:42,842
Whoo!

1384
01:22:53,753 --> 01:22:55,886
Okay, we're going
with giant robots again.

1385
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:58,055
All right, real original, guys.

1386
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,791
I'm not impressed.

1387
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:02,861
I am not impressed.

1388
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,004
We've got movement!

1389
01:23:13,006 --> 01:23:15,072
Multiple hostiles,
three kilometers southeast.

1390
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:16,241
Liwen!

1391
01:23:16,243 --> 01:23:17,175
Are you reading this?

1392
01:23:17,177 --> 01:23:19,579
That's one of my automated
factories.

1393
01:23:21,515 --> 01:23:23,046
It was Newt.

1394
01:23:23,048 --> 01:23:24,849
He's in Tokyo.

1395
01:23:24,851 --> 01:23:25,783
Locating his position.

1396
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:28,252
Hostiles, one klick away
and closing fast!

1397
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:29,821
All Jaegers, brace for contact.

1398
01:23:29,823 --> 01:23:31,656
Disengage and brace
for contact!

1399
01:23:40,967 --> 01:23:43,033
All right.

1400
01:23:43,035 --> 01:23:45,769
Let's go, all right.
Go, go, go, go!

1401
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,040
Go, baby, go, baby!

1402
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,579
Where they going?

1403
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:51,137
Well, he's pretty big.

1404
01:25:05,185 --> 01:25:07,852
All Jaegers, advance
and fire everything you've got

1405
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:08,955
on my command!

1406
01:25:16,896 --> 01:25:17,896
Go!

1407
01:25:43,656 --> 01:25:44,721
Guardian, stand down!

1408
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:45,857
We've got this!

1409
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:46,924
Negative!

1410
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:48,158
That's an order!

1411
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,327
You freaking teenagers.

1412
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:50,428
Go for the eyes!

1413
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,766
- Which ones?
- All of them.

1414
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,428
Ilya, Suresh, report.

1415
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:25,028
Do you copy?

1416
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:27,031
Come on, guys, sound off!

1417
01:26:27,033 --> 01:26:29,067
Guardian Bravo,
give me a sitrep.

1418
01:26:29,069 --> 01:26:31,068
You guys okay?

1419
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:33,104
Guardian's down.

1420
01:26:33,106 --> 01:26:35,439
I'm pinned in the Conn-Pod.

1421
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,441
Suresh.

1422
01:26:39,713 --> 01:26:41,912
Suresh didn't make it, sir.

1423
01:26:41,914 --> 01:26:44,282
Copy, Guardian.

1424
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:45,882
You just stay put,

1425
01:26:45,884 --> 01:26:48,051
and we'll send you help
as soon as we can.

1426
01:26:51,725 --> 01:26:53,056
Bracer Phoenix, report.

1427
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,294
You guys okay?

1428
01:26:56,296 --> 01:26:59,831
We're a little banged up,
but we're still in the fight.

1429
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:01,933
Us, too, Saber.

1430
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:03,800
I mean, Saber Athena, sir!

1431
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,303
Saber, Bracer,

1432
01:27:05,305 --> 01:27:07,205
prepare to intercept
at the following coordinates.

1433
01:27:07,207 --> 01:27:09,407
- Let's finish this.
- Move your ass,

1434
01:27:09,409 --> 01:27:11,108
- and don't be late.
- Copy.

1435
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:12,945
Bracer Phoenix hauling ass!

1436
01:27:15,114 --> 01:27:18,181
Gipsy to Command, do you have
a tactical scan of the hostile?

1437
01:27:18,183 --> 01:27:20,350
Assessing data
from their sensors.

1438
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:22,385
We have it, Gipsy,
but it's still compiling.

1439
01:27:22,387 --> 01:27:24,354
No time.
Can you locate the brains?

1440
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:25,956
Hostile's central brain mass
is heavily armored.

1441
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:27,325
Your weapons
won't be able to penetrate.

1442
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,126
What about a secondary brain?

1443
01:27:29,128 --> 01:27:31,328
This son of a bitch
have one of those?

1444
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,363
Hostile has
three secondary brains,

1445
01:27:33,365 --> 01:27:35,366
one for each component Kaiju.

1446
01:27:35,368 --> 01:27:37,234
Sending intel.

1447
01:27:37,236 --> 01:27:40,207
Package confirmed for Saber Athena!

1448
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:44,407
Confirmed for Bracer Phoenix.

1449
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:47,944
All right, team,
follow my lead and stay alert!

1450
01:27:47,946 --> 01:27:50,348
Fire up some of that Fury tech
Liwen grabbed us?

1451
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:51,819
Read my mind, partner.

1452
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,802
Yeah!

1453
01:28:35,294 --> 01:28:36,493
- Eject!
- Damage detected.

1454
01:28:36,495 --> 01:28:37,495
Eject! Eject!

1455
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:43,370
All pilots, eject!

1456
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:38,959
Amara!

1457
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,031
Warning.

1458
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:21,197
Neural load exceeding limit.

1459
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,033
- Hey!
- Warning.

1460
01:30:23,035 --> 01:30:25,269
- Neural load exceeding limit.
- Nate! Nate!

1461
01:30:25,271 --> 01:30:26,636
Stay with me! Stay with me!

1462
01:30:26,638 --> 01:30:29,005
Get up! Nate!

1463
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:30,142
Pilot down!

1464
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:40,254
Get up from that,
you pile of junk!

1465
01:31:04,009 --> 01:31:06,210
Bye!

1466
01:31:06,212 --> 01:31:08,545
Liwen! Is there anything
you can do to help?

1467
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:10,680
- I need more time!
- We don't have any!

1468
01:31:10,682 --> 01:31:12,649
- If the hostile reaches Mount Fuji...
- Understood.

1469
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:15,353
Not gonna let that happen.

1470
01:31:19,558 --> 01:31:22,727
Jake, you can't operate
Gipsy without a copilot!

1471
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:25,429
The strain will tear your mind apart!

1472
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:30,067
What do we do now?

1473
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:32,036
Regroup with the others.

1474
01:31:32,038 --> 01:31:33,604
Amara!

1475
01:31:33,606 --> 01:31:36,206
Gipsy Avenger,

1476
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:38,541
this is Amara Namani!

1477
01:31:38,543 --> 01:31:41,245
- Stand by for assist.
- Amara, don't.

1478
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:43,413
- You won't make it.
- I'm gonna!

1479
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:45,384
Don't! Don't!

1480
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:04,068
I told you.

1481
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:06,470
Since when do I listen?

1482
01:32:06,472 --> 01:32:08,642
Amara, you're up.

1483
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:11,175
What are you doing?

1484
01:32:11,177 --> 01:32:14,211
Getting the hell
out of your way.

1485
01:32:14,213 --> 01:32:16,580
You got this, brother.

1486
01:32:18,484 --> 01:32:21,421
Ejection sequence initiated.

1487
01:32:24,323 --> 01:32:26,756
Ejection sequence successful.

1488
01:32:26,758 --> 01:32:29,695
- You ready for this, smallie?
- One way to find out.

1489
01:32:32,097 --> 01:32:34,165
Okay.

1490
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:35,800
Stand by, Command.

1491
01:32:35,802 --> 01:32:37,734
Initiating neural handshake.

1492
01:32:37,736 --> 01:32:39,670
Establishing neural link.

1493
01:32:39,672 --> 01:32:41,272
Come on.

1494
01:32:56,189 --> 01:32:59,255
Yeah, that was supposed
to be epic, but it wasn't.

1495
01:32:59,257 --> 01:33:01,524
- Definitely not.
- Warning.

1496
01:33:01,526 --> 01:33:03,260
Cascade failure.
Multiple systems offline.

1497
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:05,830
- Reboot!
- Okay, okay, I'm on it.

1498
01:33:05,832 --> 01:33:07,630
Command to Gipsy.
Hostile is...

1499
01:33:07,632 --> 01:33:10,835
two kilometers from the summit
of Mount Fuji and closing fast!

1500
01:33:25,618 --> 01:33:29,319
Gottlieb, do you have enough
fuel left in your thrusters

1501
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:31,322
- to launch us into the atmosphere?
- The atmosphere?

1502
01:33:31,324 --> 01:33:33,189
- Yeah.
- Possibly, but there won't be

1503
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:35,526
- enough to slow your reentry.
- We don't need to slow down.

1504
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:38,362
We're gonna drop Gipsy
right on top of that thing.

1505
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:39,662
I just ejected my escape pod.

1506
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:42,765
Yeah. We'll have to use mine.

1507
01:33:42,767 --> 01:33:45,402
Jake, there's only one thruster
with enough fuel remaining.

1508
01:33:45,404 --> 01:33:47,237
- Sending location.
- All right, checking.

1509
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:49,773
We're too far away.

1510
01:33:49,775 --> 01:33:52,143
We're not gonna make it.

1511
01:33:52,145 --> 01:33:54,245
Gipsy Avenger!
Transport inbound!

1512
01:33:54,247 --> 01:33:56,682
Remote systems are online.
Sending help!

1513
01:34:01,253 --> 01:34:02,855
Scrapper!

1514
01:34:19,805 --> 01:34:21,938
I've located the thruster pod!

1515
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,907
Stand by!

1516
01:34:30,716 --> 01:34:33,184
Come on, come on!
Move them little legs!

1517
01:34:33,186 --> 01:34:34,585
The thruster's way too strong.

1518
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:36,420
There's no way
we can hold on to it!

1519
01:34:36,422 --> 01:34:38,354
Liwen, what do you got?

1520
01:34:38,356 --> 01:34:40,224
I can weld it to your hand.

1521
01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:41,791
I upgraded Scrapper's weapons.

1522
01:34:41,793 --> 01:34:43,594
Nice. I was actually
gonna do that.

1523
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:45,765
- No, you wasn't.
- Yes, I was.

1524
01:34:53,405 --> 01:34:54,671
We only got one shot at this.

1525
01:34:54,673 --> 01:34:56,709
Yeah! Then let's make it count.

1526
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:13,456
- I'm stuck!
- Stay there!

1527
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,258
You're an extra ton
we can drop on that thing!

1528
01:35:36,015 --> 01:35:38,384
- She's coming apart!
- Almost there!

1529
01:36:04,409 --> 01:36:06,910
- We're drifting off course!
- Use the plasma cannon!

1530
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,979
Disengaging safety protocol!

1531
01:36:08,981 --> 01:36:10,850
Plasma cannon engaged.

1532
01:36:14,854 --> 01:36:17,054
Warning.
Exceeding structural limits.

1533
01:36:17,056 --> 01:36:19,456
- It's working!
- Structural failure.

1534
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:20,458
Hold on!

1535
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,964
Come on! Come on!

1536
01:36:26,966 --> 01:36:28,431
Target locked!

1537
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:30,270
Jake, Amara, you need to eject!

1538
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:35,471
Disconnect!

1539
01:36:35,473 --> 01:36:37,907
Amara, disconnect!

1540
01:36:37,909 --> 01:36:40,310
I will catch you!
I promise!

1541
01:36:40,312 --> 01:36:42,481
Come on!

1542
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,385
I've got you.

1543
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:52,089
Gipsy to Command, we're getting
the hell out of here!

1544
01:36:52,091 --> 01:36:54,090
Escape pod failure.

1545
01:36:54,092 --> 01:36:57,296
No. No, no, no!

1546
01:37:00,498 --> 01:37:02,434
I'm sorry, smallie.

1547
01:37:04,704 --> 01:37:06,569
For what?

1548
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:10,541
We got to save the world.

1549
01:37:10,543 --> 01:37:13,477
Your dad would be proud.

1550
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:14,914
Ah!

1551
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:19,015
- Scrapper! Ah!
- Ah!

1552
01:37:19,017 --> 01:37:22,452
Get over here! Hurry up!

1553
01:37:22,454 --> 01:37:24,621
Move! We have to go!

1554
01:37:24,623 --> 01:37:26,924
20 kilometers to impact.
Get out of there!

1555
01:37:26,926 --> 01:37:29,329
Go! Go!

1556
01:37:35,467 --> 01:37:38,604
We're in!
Close the door!

1557
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,478
- Hang on!
- I am hanging on!

1558
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,112
Hang tighter!

1559
01:38:50,476 --> 01:38:53,609
No! No!

1560
01:38:55,013 --> 01:38:58,614
Okay, you know what?
Plan B. Always a plan B.

1561
01:39:02,053 --> 01:39:04,086
Anyone who's listening,

1562
01:39:04,088 --> 01:39:06,556
this is Ranger Lambert.

1563
01:39:06,558 --> 01:39:08,625
Be advised, we just
caught ourselves a Newt.

1564
01:39:08,627 --> 01:39:09,827
Copy that.

1565
01:39:09,829 --> 01:39:11,694
There he is.

1566
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:13,162
I'm glad
you're still okay, man.

1567
01:39:13,164 --> 01:39:15,898
You, too, brother.
I knew you could do it.

1568
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,704
Well, I had a lot of help.

1569
01:39:20,739 --> 01:39:23,042
- Nice work, Ranger Namani.
- Thank you, sir.

1570
01:39:28,113 --> 01:39:30,680
- Never seen snow before.
- So out of all the things

1571
01:39:30,682 --> 01:39:33,684
to notice right now,
you're noticing snow?

1572
01:39:33,686 --> 01:39:35,152
Big, dead Kaiju is just,
is right there,

1573
01:39:35,154 --> 01:39:36,787
- and I'm not sure if...
- Okay, okay, all right.

1574
01:39:36,789 --> 01:39:38,154
Is this the part
where you're gonna give me

1575
01:39:38,156 --> 01:39:39,422
one of those
big, dumb speeches, 'cause...

1576
01:39:39,424 --> 01:39:41,791
Did everyone think it was dumb
or is that just your opinion...

1577
01:39:41,793 --> 01:39:43,559
Just be honest, how many times
did you practice that in front

1578
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:44,495
- of the mirror?
- It was motivational.

1579
01:39:44,497 --> 01:39:45,696
- Okay.
- You can be whoever you want to be.

1580
01:39:45,698 --> 01:39:47,197
Oh!

1581
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:48,665
- Fire!
- Okay. Oh, now you want to play that?

1582
01:39:48,667 --> 01:39:49,632
I'm a natural at this.

1583
01:39:49,634 --> 01:39:50,634
- No, you're not a natural because...
- Ha!

1584
01:39:50,636 --> 01:39:52,635
Give me a break.
I've never done this before.

1585
01:39:54,973 --> 01:39:56,909
There you go. Boom!

1586
01:39:59,645 --> 01:40:01,979
We did it!

1587
01:40:22,534 --> 01:40:24,201
You think this is over, huh?

1588
01:40:24,203 --> 01:40:27,604
You think you've saved
your crappy little world?

1589
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:29,805
We're gonna keep coming!

1590
01:40:29,807 --> 01:40:33,042
We are never going to stop,
and sooner or later,

1591
01:40:33,044 --> 01:40:35,547
your luck is going to run out!

1592
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:39,882
Nah.

1593
01:40:39,884 --> 01:40:42,653
The things in your head?

1594
01:40:42,655 --> 01:40:43,819
The Precursors?

1595
01:40:43,821 --> 01:40:46,089
Tell them we're not afraid.

1596
01:40:46,091 --> 01:40:47,890
Tell 'em, next time,

1597
01:40:47,892 --> 01:40:50,059
they won't need to worry
about coming for us,

1598
01:40:50,061 --> 01:40:52,731
'cause we're gonna
come for them.
