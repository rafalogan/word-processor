1
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,011
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,847
You see where you're going?

3
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:14,015
Okay.

4
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:16,100
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,352
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:20,271
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,190
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:23,733
Okay?

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,985
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,153
Are you sure?

11
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,571
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,989
- No.
- How about now?

13
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:33,242
All right.

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,828
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,705
Nice!

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,875
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,126
Here you go.

18
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,629
Hey, you guys want mayo?
Or mustard?

19
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,172
Or both?

20
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,424
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

21
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,634
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,802
Two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,887
Got it!

24
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:54,889
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,807
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,185
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,561
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,607
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,485
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,613
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,990
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

32
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,200
All right.

33
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:15,660
We're coming. We're hungry.

34
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,287
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,583
Lila?

36
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,504
Honey?

37
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,467
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,353
Babe?

39
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,690
Babe?

40
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,526
Boys!

41
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,279
Boys!

42
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,740
Laura!

43
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,785
You don't need to do that.

44
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,997
Because you're just
holding the position.

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,291
Yeah.

46
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,376
That was close.

47
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,129
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

48
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,672
I would like to try again.

49
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,385
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

50
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,095
It's fun.

51
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,264
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

52
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,516
And you've won.

53
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:04,769
Congratulations.

54
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,062
Fair game.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,773
Good sport.

56
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,150
You have fun?

57
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,904
It was fun.

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,053
This thing on?

59
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,224
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

60
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,269
If you find this recording...

61
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,189
don't post it on social media.

62
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,982
It's gonna be a real tearjerker.

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,069
I don't know if
you're ever gonna see these.

64
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,279
I don't even know
if you're still...

65
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,698
Oh, God, I hope so.

66
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,785
Today's day 21.

67
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,204
No, 22.

68
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,416
You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...

69
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,751
of staring into
the literal void of space,

70
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,045
I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.

71
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,630
Infection's run its course,

72
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,257
thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.

73
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,426
You'd love her.

74
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,010
Very practical.

75
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,555
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,728
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

77
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,981
and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

78
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,859
and bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

79
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,989
But it's now dead in the water.

80
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:43,659
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

81
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,538
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...

82
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,708
and that'll be it.

83
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,089
Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...

84
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,966
but I gotta say
I was really hoping

85
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,843
to pull off one last one.

86
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,970
But it looks like...

87
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, you know
what it looks like.

88
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,184
Don't feel bad about this.

89
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,145
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

90
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:15,024
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

91
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,156
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

92
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,200
Go rest my eyes.

93
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,746
Please know...

94
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,542
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

95
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,712
I'm fine. Totally fine.

96
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,672
I dream about you.

97
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,842
Because it's always you.

98
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,587
Couldn't stop him.

99
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,755
Neither could I.

100
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,090
Hang on.

101
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,094
I lost the kid.

102
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,223
Tony, we lost.

103
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,518
Is...?

104
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,146
- Good.
- Oh, my God!

105
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,815
Oh, my God!

106
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,321
It's okay.

107
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,038
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

108
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,835
World governments are in pieces.

109
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,795
The parts
that are still working...

110
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:50,799
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

111
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,137
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

112
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,388
Thanos wiped out...

113
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,977
...50% of
all living creatures.

114
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,233
Where is he now? Where?

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,110
We don't know.

116
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,363
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

117
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,034
What's wrong with him?

118
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,078
He's pissed.

119
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,580
He thinks he failed.

120
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,124
Which, of course, he did...

121
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,335
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

122
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,920
Honestly,
until this exact second

123
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,129
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

124
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,714
Maybe I am.

125
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,257
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

126
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,343
Deep space scans...

127
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,553
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

128
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,348
Tony, you fought him.

129
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,432
Who told you that?

130
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,142
I didn't fight him.

131
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,977
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

132
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,229
while the Bleecker Street
magician

133
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,563
gave away the store.

134
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,648
That's what happened.

135
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,066
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

136
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,860
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

137
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,365
I saw this coming
a few years back.

138
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,158
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

139
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,118
Thought I was dreaming.

140
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,286
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

141
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,205
And I needed you.

142
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,414
As in, past tense.

143
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,835
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

144
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,127
Sorry.

145
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,798
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

146
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,884
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

147
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,094
Tony, Tony!

148
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,556
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

149
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,516
was a suit of armor
around the world.

150
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,600
Remember that?

151
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,353
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

152
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,646
That's what we needed.

153
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:28,897
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

154
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,482
I said we'd lose.

155
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,818
You said,
"We'll do that together, too."

156
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,444
And guess what, Cap?

157
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,904
We lost.

158
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,364
And you weren't there.

159
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,117
But that's what we do, right?

160
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,120
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

161
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,247
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

162
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,331
- Okay.
- Right?

163
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,666
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

164
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:48,917
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

165
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,460
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

166
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,254
We need you.
You're new blood.

167
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,257
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

168
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,633
I got no coordinates...

169
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,553
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

170
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,430
Zero. Zip. Nada.

171
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,348
No trust, liar.

172
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,146
Here, take this.

173
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,440
You find him, you put that on...

174
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,442
you hide.

175
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,445
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

176
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,322
Let me...

177
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,121
Bruce gave him a sedative.

178
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,998
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

179
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,542
You guys take care of him...

180
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,252
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

181
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,837
Where are you going?

182
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,672
To kill Thanos.

183
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,927
Hey.

184
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,137
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

185
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,972
and between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

186
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,558
We realize up there
is more your territory,

187
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:47,726
but this is our fight, too.

188
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,061
You even know where he is?

189
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,395
I know people who might.

190
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,897
Don't bother.

191
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,608
I can tell you where Thanos is.

192
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,113
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

193
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,785
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

194
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,038
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

195
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,623
I'd ask...

196
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,834
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

197
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,337
And his answer
was always the same.

198
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,550
"To the Garden."

199
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,929
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

200
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,639
So, where is he?

201
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,058
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

202
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,227
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

203
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,104
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

204
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,481
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

205
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,983
Until two days ago...

206
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,403
on this planet.

207
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,613
Thanos is there.

208
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,033
He used the stones again.

209
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,035
Hey, hey, hey.

210
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,079
We'd be going in shorthanded,
you know?

211
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,706
Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

212
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,332
So, let's get 'em.

213
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,959
Use them to bring everyone back.

214
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,210
Just like that?

215
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,878
Yeah. Just like that.

216
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,215
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

217
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:03,093
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

218
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,886
If we do this, how do we know

219
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,222
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

220
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,016
Because before
you didn't have me.

221
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,059
Hey, new girl?

222
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,937
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

223
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,731
And if you don't mind my asking,

224
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,940
where the hell have you been
all this time?

225
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,317
There are a lot of
other planets in the universe.

226
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,362
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

227
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,092
I like this one.

228
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,099
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

229
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:13,872
Okay.

230
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,666
Who here hasn't been to space?

231
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,252
Why?

232
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,004
You better not throw up
on my ship.

233
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,464
Approaching jump in three...

234
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,716
two, one.

235
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,981
I'll head down for recon.

236
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,709
This is gonna work, Steve.

237
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,670
I know it will.

238
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,801
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

239
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,888
No satellites.
No ships. No armies.

240
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,557
No ground defenses of any kind.

241
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,310
It's just him.

242
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,688
And that's enough.

243
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,945
No.

244
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,164
Where are they?

245
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,166
Answer the question.

246
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,046
The universe
required correction.

247
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,008
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

248
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,802
beyond temptation.

249
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,929
You murdered trillions!

250
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,182
You should be grateful.

251
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,604
Where are the stones?

252
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,147
Gone.

253
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,399
Reduced to atoms.

254
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,567
You used them two days ago!

255
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,946
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

256
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,323
It nearly killed me.

257
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,493
But the work is done.

258
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,579
It always will be.

259
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:46,543
I am inevitable.

260
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,214
We have to tear this place
apart. He has to be lying!

261
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,590
My father is many things.

262
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,552
A liar is not one of them.

263
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,890
Thank you, daughter.

264
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,687
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

265
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,194
What?

266
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,613
What did you do?

267
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,950
I went for the head.

268
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,023
So...

269
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,819
...I went on a date
the other day.

270
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,654
It's the first time
in five years.

271
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,156
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

272
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,368
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

273
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,912
What did you talk about?

274
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,749
Same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

275
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,001
My job, his job.

276
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,879
How much we miss the Mets.

277
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,842
And then things got quiet...

278
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,556
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

279
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,224
What about you?

280
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,562
I cried just before dessert.

281
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,443
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

282
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,361
That's great.

283
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,196
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

284
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,407
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

285
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,909
And that's it.
That's those little

286
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,328
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

287
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:31,207
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

288
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,586
I went in the ice in '45,

289
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,046
right after I met
the love of my life.

290
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,674
Woke up 70 years later.

291
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,846
You gotta move on.

292
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,184
Gotta move on.

293
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,441
The world is in our hands.

294
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,693
It's left to us, guys.

295
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,070
And we gotta do
something with it.

296
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,198
Otherwise...

297
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,826
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

298
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,098
What the hell?

299
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,736
Hope?

300
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,937
Kid!

301
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,147
Hey, kid!

302
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,695
What the hell happened here?

303
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,145
Oh, my God!

304
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,441
Please!

305
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,151
Please, please!

306
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,320
No, no, no. No.

307
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,156
No.

308
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,493
Excuse me. Sorry.

309
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,952
Cassie, no.

310
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,579
No, no, no.

311
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,666
No, no.

312
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,503
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

313
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,886
What?

314
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,292
Cassie?

315
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,837
Dad?

316
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,282
You're so big!

317
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,880
Yeah. We boarded

318
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,091
that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.

319
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,968
It was an infectious
garbage scow.

320
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,595
So, thanks for the hot tip.

321
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,096
Well, you were closer.

322
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,639
Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.

323
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,057
You get a reading
on those tremors?

324
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,810
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

325
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,021
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

326
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,355
Nat.

327
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,775
It's an earthquake
under the ocean.

328
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,778
We handle it by not handling it.

329
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,655
Carol, are we seeing you here
next month?

330
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,199
Not likely.

331
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,825
What? You gonna get
another haircut?

332
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,327
Listen, fur face.

333
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,287
I'm covering a lot of territory.

334
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,247
The things
that are happening on Earth

335
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,582
are happening everywhere.

336
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,751
On thousands of planets.

337
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,419
All right, all right.
That's a good point.

338
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:09,587
That's a good point.

339
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,839
So, you might not see me
for a long time.

340
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,342
All right. Well...

341
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:17,345
This channel's always active.

342
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,597
So, if anything goes sideways...

343
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,183
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

344
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,518
comes through me.

345
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,228
Okay.

346
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,771
All right.

347
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,606
Good luck.

348
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,199
Where are you?

349
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,367
Mexico.

350
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,161
The Federales found a room
full of bodies.

351
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,955
Looks like
a bunch of cartel guys...

352
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,082
never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

353
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,959
It's probably a rival gang.

354
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,335
Except it isn't.

355
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,671
It's definitely Barton.

356
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,840
What he's done here...

357
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:57,176
what he's been doing
for the last few years...

358
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,804
I mean,
the scene that he left...

359
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,806
I gotta tell you,

360
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,350
there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.

361
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,191
Will you find out
where he's going next?

362
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,238
Nat?

363
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,741
Please?

364
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,661
Okay.

365
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,297
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

366
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,215
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

367
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,721
You here to do your laundry?

368
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,472
And to see a friend.

369
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,226
Clearly, your friend is fine.

370
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,272
You know, I saw a pod of whales

371
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,481
when I was coming over
the bridge.

372
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,483
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

373
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,902
cleaner water.

374
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,945
You know,
if you're about to tell me

375
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,989
to look on the bright side...

376
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,743
I'm about to hit you in the head

377
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,953
with a peanut butter sandwich.

378
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,081
Sorry.

379
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,416
Force of habit.

380
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,098
You know,
I keep telling everybody

381
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,808
they should move on...

382
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,644
and grow.

383
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,146
Some do.

384
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,109
But not us.

385
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,904
If I move on, who does this?

386
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,406
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

387
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,871
I used to have nothing.

388
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,958
And then I got this.

389
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,962
This job.

390
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,091
This family.

391
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,765
And I was better because of it.

392
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,566
And even though they're gone...

393
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,948
I'm still trying to be better.

394
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,412
I think we both need
to get a life.

395
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,249
You first.

396
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,964
Hi, hi!

397
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,257
Is anyone home?

398
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,134
This is Scott Lang.

399
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,137
We met a few years ago
at the airport...

400
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,972
in Germany?

401
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:50,433
I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.

402
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,184
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

403
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,229
Ant-Man?
I know you know that.

404
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,480
It's the front gate.

405
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,982
I really need
to talk to you guys.

406
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,322
Scott.

407
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,283
Are you okay?

408
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,451
Yeah.

409
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,621
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

410
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,540
Only to make conversation.

411
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,251
All right, so...

412
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,337
five years ago, right before...

413
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,048
Thanos...

414
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,508
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

415
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:27,178
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

416
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,472
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

417
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,182
Hope. She's my...

418
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,977
She was my...

419
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:37,897
She was supposed to pull me out.

420
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,648
And then Thanos happened...

421
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,484
and I got stuck in there.

422
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,903
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

423
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,404
Yeah, but that's just it.

424
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,739
It wasn't.

425
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,115
For me, it was five hours.

426
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,617
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

427
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,785
aren't like they are up here.

428
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,411
Everything is unpredictable.

429
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,788
Is that anybody's sandwich?

430
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,206
I'm starving.

431
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,665
Scott.

432
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,125
What are you talking about?

433
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,377
So...

434
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,922
what I'm saying is...

435
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,217
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

436
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,260
The only problem is right now

437
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,762
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

438
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,846
But what if we did?

439
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,807
I can't stop thinking about it.

440
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,892
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

441
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,185
and we could navigate it?

442
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,853
What if there was a way...

443
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,563
that we could enter
the quantum realm

444
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:20,731
at a certain point in time...

445
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,358
but then exit the quantum realm

446
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,609
at another point in time?

447
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,111
Like...

448
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,947
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

449
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,698
Are you talking
about a time machine?

450
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,618
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

451
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:33,828
This is more like a...

452
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,790
Yeah. Like a time machine.

453
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,750
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

454
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,961
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

455
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,295
There's gotta be...

456
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,422
some way...

457
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,299
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

458
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,759
I get emails from a raccoon...

459
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,928
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

460
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,764
So, who do we talk to
about this?

461
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,117
Chow time!

462
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:16,620
Maguna.

463
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,293
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

464
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
Define "lunch"

465
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,671
- or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

466
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,549
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

467
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,050
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

468
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:31,218
I'm making for Mom.

469
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,558
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

470
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,643
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

471
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,520
- No.
- That's what you want.

472
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,814
How did you find this?

473
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,816
- Garage.
- Really?

474
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,985
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

475
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,738
I found it, though.

476
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,656
You like going in the garage?

477
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,742
So does Daddy.

478
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,661
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

479
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,624
So, I'm gonna...

480
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,685
No.
We know what it sounds like.

481
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:22,811
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

482
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:23,896
is anything really impossible?

483
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,190
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

484
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:28,025
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

485
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,151
Can we agree on that?

486
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,402
Thank you.

487
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,696
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

488
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,281
- I did.
- No.

489
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,325
You accidentally survived.

490
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,577
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

491
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,830
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

492
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,209
A time heist?

493
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,503
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

494
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,796
Why didn't we think
of this before?

495
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,423
Because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

496
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,676
The stones are in the past.

497
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,094
We could go back,
we could get them.

498
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,554
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

499
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,640
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

500
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:00,808
I don't believe we would.

501
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,936
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

502
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,522
However, high hopes
won't help...

503
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,649
if there's no logical,
tangible way

504
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:12,194
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

505
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,238
I believe
the most likely outcome

506
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,322
will be our collective demise.

507
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:18,242
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

508
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:21,078
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

509
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,705
no betting on sporting events.

510
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,623
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

511
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,917
Are you seriously telling me

512
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,794
that your plan
to save the universe...

513
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,629
is based on Back to the Future?

514
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,507
- Is it?
- No.

515
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,717
Good. You had me
worried there.

516
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,843
'Cause that would be horseshit.

517
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,304
That's not how
quantum physics works.

518
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,638
Tony.

519
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,058
We have to take a stand.

520
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,602
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

521
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:49,231
I know you got
a lot on the line.

522
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,276
You got a wife, a daughter.

523
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,945
But I lost someone
very important to me.

524
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,697
A lotta people did.

525
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,867
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

526
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:01,201
to bring everyone back,

527
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,786
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

528
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,663
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

529
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,708
I can't.

530
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,212
Mommy told me
to come and save you.

531
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,715
Good job. I'm saved.

532
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,509
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

533
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,719
Anything else.

534
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,596
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

535
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,056
Look, the table's set for six.

536
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,640
Tony. I get it.

537
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,101
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

538
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,395
But this is a second chance.

539
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,523
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

540
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,233
Can't roll the dice on it.

541
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,237
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

542
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:41,700
Well, he's scared.

543
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,494
He's not wrong.

544
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,662
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

545
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,039
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

546
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,958
No, I wanna do it right.

547
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,838
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

548
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,091
Bigger than his?

549
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,385
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

550
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,511
Try some of that.

551
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:01,595
Have some eggs.

552
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm so confused.

553
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,265
These are confusing times.

554
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,267
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

555
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,937
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

556
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,314
I know, it's crazy.

557
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,690
I'm wearing shirts now.

558
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,693
Yeah. What? How? Why?

559
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,488
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

560
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,740
Except it was worse for me...

561
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,117
'cause I lost twice.

562
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,077
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

563
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,287
and then, we all lost.

564
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,622
No one blamed you, Bruce.

565
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:30,165
I did.

566
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,168
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

567
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,378
like he's
some kind of disease...

568
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,921
something to get rid of.

569
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,341
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

570
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,052
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

571
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,805
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

572
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,223
and now, look at me.

573
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,600
Best of both worlds.

574
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,686
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

575
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,187
Can we get a photo?

576
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,606
100%, little person.

577
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,817
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

578
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,278
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

579
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,946
Say "green."

580
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,365
- Green.
- Green.

581
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,450
Did you get that?

582
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,868
That's a good one.

583
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,912
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

584
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,501
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

585
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:15,752
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

586
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,546
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

587
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,714
Stranger danger.

588
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,340
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

589
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,425
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

590
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:22,634
But come on. The kid...

591
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,136
I don't want a picture
with them.

592
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,304
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

593
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,722
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

594
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,348
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

595
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,476
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

596
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,768
Okay.

597
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,853
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

598
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,605
No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

599
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,440
Hulk out!

600
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,649
Bruce.

601
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,067
Dab.

602
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,028
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

603
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,404
She knows better.

604
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:44,239
About what we were saying.

605
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,616
Right.

606
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,245
The whole time travel do-over?

607
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:55,292
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

608
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,002
Well, you pulled this off.

609
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:01,840
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

610
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,667
I've got a mild inspiration.

611
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,043
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

612
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,212
So, I'd like to run one last sim

613
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,880
before we pack it in
for the night.

614
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,050
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

615
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,510
inverted, please.

616
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,678
Processing.

617
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,642
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

618
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,811
factoring in spectral decomp.

619
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,938
- That'll take a second.
- Just a moment.

620
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,858
And don't worry if it doesn't
pan out. I'm just kinda...

621
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,861
Model rendered.

622
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,708
Shit!

623
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,293
Shit!

624
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,048
What are you
doing up, little miss?

625
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,925
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

626
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,302
Only Mommy says that word.

627
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,886
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

628
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,054
Why are you up?

629
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,556
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

630
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:33,890
Why do you think?

631
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,601
No, I got something on my mind.

632
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,019
I got something on my mind.

633
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,729
Was it juice pops?

634
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,481
Sure was.

635
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,651
That's extortion.
That's a word.

636
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:45,986
What kind you want?

637
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,154
Great minds think alike.

638
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,156
Juice pops exactly...

639
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,451
was on my mind.

640
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:54,995
You done? Yeah?

641
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,747
Now you are.

642
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:58,498
Here. Wipe.

643
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,879
Good. That face goes there.

644
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,297
Tell me a story.

645
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,049
A story.

646
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,343
Once upon a time,
Maguna went to bed. The end.

647
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,094
That is a horrible story.

648
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,013
Come on,
that's your favorite story.

649
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:14,890
Love you tons.

650
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,727
I love you 3,000.

651
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,198
3,000.
That's crazy.

652
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,201
Go to bed
or I'll sell all your toys.

653
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,745
Night night.

654
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,121
Not that it's a competition...

655
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,540
but she loves me 3,000.

656
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,792
Does she, now?

657
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,003
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

658
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,552
Whatcha reading?

659
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,638
Just a book on composting.

660
00:41:54,805 --> 00:41:56,890
What's new with composting?

661
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,394
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

662
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,479
By the way.

663
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,523
And, you know,

664
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,733
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

665
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,360
Time travel.

666
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,861
What?

667
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,706
That's amazing...

668
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:22,791
and terrifying.

669
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,418
That's right.

670
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:33,427
We got really lucky.

671
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:34,594
Yeah.

672
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,887
I know.

673
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,180
A lot of people didn't.

674
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,974
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

675
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,060
Sorta seems like you can.

676
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,854
Not if I stop.

677
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,899
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

678
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,693
Tony...

679
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:51,945
trying to get you to stop...

680
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,740
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

681
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,704
Something tells me...

682
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,081
I should put it in a lockbox

683
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,666
and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

684
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,085
and go to bed.

685
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,510
But would you be able to rest?

686
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,560
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

687
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,896
Scott, fire up...

688
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:27,981
the van thing.

689
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,318
Breakers are set.

690
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,320
Emergency generators
are on standby.

691
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:35,197
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

692
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,492
I don't want to lose
Tiny here in the 1950s.

693
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,536
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

694
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,580
You can't say things like that.

695
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,332
It was a bad joke.

696
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,335
You were kidding, right?

697
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,588
I have no idea. We're talking
about time travel here.

698
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,007
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

699
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,842
We're good!

700
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,344
Get your helmet on.

701
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,846
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

702
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,556
let you walk around for an hour,

703
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,141
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

704
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,309
Make sense?

705
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,228
Perfectly not confusing.

706
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,355
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

707
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,943
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

708
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,446
On a count of three...

709
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:20,492
Three, two, one.

710
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,413
Guys?

711
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,457
This doesn't feel right.

712
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,542
What is this?

713
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,626
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

714
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:30,710
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

715
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,795
Yes, it's Scott.

716
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,300
- What's going on, Bruce?
- My back!

717
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,385
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

718
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:39,469
Could I get a little space here?

719
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:40,679
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

720
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:41,805
I'm working on it.

721
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:49,855
It's a baby.

722
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,565
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

723
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,191
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

724
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,734
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

725
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,069
Oh, my God.

726
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:58,154
And... kill it!

727
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,369
Somebody peed my pants.

728
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,495
Thank God.

729
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,874
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

730
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,170
Or just me me.

731
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:15,797
Time travel!

732
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:20,552
What?

733
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,472
I see this as an absolute win.

734
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,436
Why the long face?

735
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,355
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

736
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:16,608
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

737
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:18,193
It's the EPR Paradox.

738
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:19,986
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

739
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,071
you might've wound up...

740
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,614
pushing time through Lang.

741
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:23,907
It's tricky, dangerous.

742
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,450
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

743
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,618
You did.

744
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:27,953
Did I?

745
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,788
Well, thank God I'm here.

746
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,207
Regardless, I fixed it.

747
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,585
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

748
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:38,922
I just want peace.

749
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,259
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

750
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,512
Me, too.

751
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,223
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

752
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,225
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

753
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,727
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

754
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,730
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

755
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,567
And maybe not die trying.

756
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:00,777
Would be nice.

757
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,322
Sounds like a deal.

758
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:28,930
Tony, I don't know.

759
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:30,724
Why?

760
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,684
He made it for you.

761
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,602
Plus, honestly, I have to
get it out of the garage

762
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,438
before Morgan takes it sledding.

763
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,111
Thank you, Tony.

764
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,655
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

765
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,741
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

766
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:52,787
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

767
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,706
We're working on that right now.

768
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,850
Hey, Humie.

769
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,186
Where's Big Green?

770
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,563
The kitchen, I think.

771
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,024
That's awesome.

772
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,319
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

773
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:26,196
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

774
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,490
Oh, God.

775
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:31,117
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

776
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,420
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

777
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,256
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

778
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,757
Hey, have
a little compassion, pal.

779
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,884
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

780
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,594
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

781
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:33,471
You shouldn't have come.

782
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:36,558
Valkyrie!

783
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,435
Great to see you, angry girl!

784
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,813
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

785
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,858
- This is Rocket.
- How ya doing?

786
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:48,278
He won't see you.

787
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,654
It's that bad?

788
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,239
We only see him once a month

789
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,450
when he comes
in for "supplies."

790
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:56,661
It's that bad.

791
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,829
Yeah.

792
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,384
What the...?

793
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,472
Something died in here!

794
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:19,851
Hello? Thor!

795
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,061
Are you here about the cable?

796
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,898
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

797
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,234
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

798
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:29,986
Thor?

799
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,496
Boys! Oh, my God!

800
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:43,875
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

801
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:46,628
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

802
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,297
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

803
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,506
That's not necessary.

804
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,635
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

805
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:54,928
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

806
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,346
Long time no see.

807
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,513
Beer's in the bucket.

808
00:50:57,597 --> 00:50:58,765
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

809
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:00,642
No password, obviously.

810
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,228
Thor, he's back.

811
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,064
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

812
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:07,649
Noobmaster.

813
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,276
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

814
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,611
I am sick of this.

815
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,197
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

816
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,448
You know, the God of Thunder.

817
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,784
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

818
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:19,452
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

819
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,079
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

820
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,873
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

821
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,333
That's right, yes!

822
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,293
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

823
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,003
Thank you, Thor.

824
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:30,505
Let me know if
he bothers you again, okay?

825
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:31,881
Thank you very much. I will.

826
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,259
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

827
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,761
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

828
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,057
Buddy.

829
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,685
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

830
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,894
Why, don't I look all right?

831
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,729
You look like melted ice cream.

832
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,817
So, what's up? You just here
for a hang, or what?

833
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,111
We need your help.

834
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,488
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

835
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,990
What, like the cable?

836
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,367
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

837
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:00,535
Like Thanos.

838
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:22,557
Don't say that name.

839
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,394
Yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

840
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,109
Please take your hand off me.

841
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:39,574
Now, I know that guy...

842
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,617
might scare you.

843
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,244
Why would I be...?

844
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:46,497
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

845
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,499
I'm the one
who killed that guy, remember?

846
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,711
Anyone else here kill that guy?

847
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,215
Nope.

848
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:57,759
Didn't think so.

849
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,678
Korg, why don't you
tell everybody

850
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:03,097
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

851
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,682
Stormbreaker?

852
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,476
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

853
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,774
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay?

854
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,941
I've been there myself.

855
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,402
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

856
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,905
Was it Natasha?

857
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:21,240
It was you.

858
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:23,368
You helped me.

859
00:53:24,577 --> 00:53:26,037
So, why don't you ask...

860
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,457
the Asgardians down there...

861
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,334
how much my help is worth?

862
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,466
The ones that are left, anyway.

863
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:40,593
I think we could
bring them back.

864
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:42,512
Stop.

865
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,390
Stop, okay?

866
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,682
I know you think I'm down here

867
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:48,393
wallowing in my own self-pity...

868
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,104
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

869
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,356
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

870
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,982
We're good here, mate.

871
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,110
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

872
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:58,778
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

873
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,029
Goodbye.

874
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,118
We need you, pal.

875
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,546
There's beer on the ship.

876
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,218
What kind?

877
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,536
What I want you can't give me.

878
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,602
You shouldn't be here.

879
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,065
Neither should you.

880
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,531
I've got a job to do.

881
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,742
Is that what
you're calling this?

882
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,246
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

883
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,169
We found something.

884
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,007
A chance, maybe.

885
00:57:08,092 --> 00:57:10,553
Don't.

886
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,930
Don't what?

887
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,435
Don't give me hope.

888
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,232
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

889
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,088
You're drifting left.

890
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,382
One side there, Lebowski.

891
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:52,887
Ratchet, how's it going?

892
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:54,055
It's Rocket.

893
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,766
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

894
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,272
Time travel suit, not bad.

895
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,233
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

896
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,318
I'm being very careful.

897
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,903
No, you're being very Hulky.

898
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:09,987
I'm being careful.

899
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,530
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

900
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,948
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

901
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:14,283
out of existence, this is it.

902
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,118
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

903
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,204
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

904
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:21,499
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

905
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:22,708
No do-overs.

906
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,086
Plus two test runs.

907
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,091
One test run.

908
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,010
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

909
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,470
I'm game.

910
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,432
I'll do it.

911
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,226
Clint, now you're gonna feel

912
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:41,811
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

913
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:42,895
Don't worry about that.

914
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,105
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

915
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,898
If we can do this, you know...

916
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,401
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

917
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,735
You know, and...

918
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:54,824
First of all, that's horrible.

919
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:55,908
It's Thanos.

920
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,077
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

921
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,413
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

922
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,956
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

923
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,290
before Thanos gets them...

924
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,210
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

925
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,212
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

926
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,296
Well, that's what I heard.

927
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,506
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

928
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:12,466
Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...

929
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,218
- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.

930
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:15,428
Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.

931
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,512
Hot Tub Time Machine.

932
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:17,638
Hot Tub Time Machine.

933
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:18,973
Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.

934
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,225
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

935
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,227
Die Hard.
No, that's not one.

936
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,437
This is known.

937
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:25,813
I don't know
why everyone believes that,

938
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:26,939
but that isn't true.

939
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,024
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

940
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,527
that past becomes your future...

941
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,655
and your former present
becomes the past...

942
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:37,450
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

943
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,826
Exactly.

944
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,288
So Back to the Future
is a bunch of bullshit?

945
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,169
All right, Clint.

946
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:51,338
We're going in three, two...

947
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,506
one.

948
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,205
Cooper?

949
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,915
Where are my headphones?

950
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:08,999
Lila?

951
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,210
- I never had them.
- Lila?

952
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,004
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

953
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:15,881
Lila! Lila!

954
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:22,388
Yeah, Dad?

955
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,309
Dad?

956
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,063
Lila!

957
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,363
Hey. Hey, look at me.

958
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,656
You okay?

959
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,409
Yeah. Yeah.

960
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,495
It worked.

961
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:49,623
It worked.

962
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,587
Okay, so the how works.

963
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:58,299
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

964
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,926
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

965
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,761
with at least one of
the six Infinity Stones.

966
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,430
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

967
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,681
for "damn near been killed"

968
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,182
by one of
the six Infinity Stones.

969
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,517
Well, I haven't...

970
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:09,602
but I don't even know

971
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:11,020
what the hell
you're all talking about.

972
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,064
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

973
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,941
for one round-trip each.

974
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,318
And these stones have been

975
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,320
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

976
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,779
Our history.

977
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,949
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

978
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,910
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

979
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:27,620
Correct.

980
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,581
So, let's start with the Aether.

981
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,957
Thor, what do you know?

982
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:38,756
Is he asleep?

983
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,467
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

984
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,221
Where to start?

985
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,434
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

986
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,728
Someone called it
a stone before.

987
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:58,108
It's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

988
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,902
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

989
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,153
and stop saying that.

990
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:04,156
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

991
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,200
My grandfather,
many years ago...

992
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,870
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

993
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,748
Scary beings.

994
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,625
So, Jane, actually...

995
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:16,752
There she is.

996
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,589
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

997
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,802
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

998
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,805
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

999
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,015
and she became very, very sick.

1000
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,059
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1001
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,310
which is where I'm from...

1002
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,437
and we had to try and fix her.

1003
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,231
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1004
01:03:37,398 --> 01:03:40,776
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1005
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:44,154
who's dead and...

1006
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,074
You know, Jane and I

1007
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,076
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1008
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:51,412
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1009
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:52,871
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1010
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:54,790
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1011
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,500
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1012
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,002
is impermanence.

1013
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,046
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1014
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,257
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1015
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,551
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1016
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,346
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1017
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,432
Quill was a person.

1018
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,518
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1019
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,103
Look.

1020
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,897
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1021
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,234
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1022
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:23,527
I'll take you to space.

1023
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,822
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1024
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:28,949
What is Vormir?

1025
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,284
A dominion of death...

1026
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,870
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1027
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,792
It's where
Thanos murdered my sister.

1028
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,258
Not it.

1029
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,636
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

1030
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,597
Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1031
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,724
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1032
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:55,267
Nice place
in the Village, though.

1033
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,935
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

1034
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:58,145
Bleecker Street.

1035
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,354
Wait, he lived in New York?

1036
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:00,981
No, he lived in Toronto.

1037
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,107
Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

1038
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:03,192
Have you been listening
to anything?

1039
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,276
Guys.

1040
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,028
If you pick the right year,

1041
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,738
there are three stones
in New York.

1042
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:11,909
Shut the front door.

1043
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,789
All right.
We have a plan.

1044
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:21,543
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1045
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,138
Five years ago, we lost.

1046
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:35,766
All of us.

1047
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,061
We lost friends.

1048
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,438
We lost family.

1049
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,234
We lost a part of ourselves.

1050
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:49,029
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1051
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,283
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1052
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,036
Get the stones. Get them back.

1053
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,038
One round-trip each.

1054
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,289
No mistakes...

1055
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,500
no do-overs.

1056
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:03,544
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1057
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,546
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1058
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,714
Be careful.

1059
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,633
Look out for each other.

1060
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,886
This is the fight
of our lives...

1061
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,347
and we're gonna win.

1062
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:18,517
Whatever it takes.

1063
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,230
Good luck.

1064
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:24,481
He's pretty good at that.

1065
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:25,816
- Right?
- All right.

1066
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:26,984
You heard the man.

1067
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,318
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

1068
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:30,821
Trackers engaged.

1069
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,448
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1070
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,994
Okay, I'll do my best.

1072
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,954
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1073
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,167
See ya in a minute.

1074
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:38,889
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1075
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:41,266
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1076
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:43,352
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1077
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,619
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1078
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,747
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1079
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:32,943
I'd be careful going that way.

1080
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,653
We just had the floors waxed.

1081
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:41,618
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1082
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:46,081
You're about
five years too early.

1083
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,001
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1084
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:50,585
about 20 blocks that way.

1085
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,380
What do you want from him?

1086
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,299
That, actually.

1087
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,511
I'm afraid not.

1088
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,305
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1089
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:03,223
You don't want to do this.

1090
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,058
You're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1091
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:06,643
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1092
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,237
Let's start over, shall we?

1093
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,375
For you, Lady Jane.

1094
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:32,836
So you have anything with pants?

1095
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,129
Pants?

1096
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,298
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1097
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:38,091
- Yes, milady.
- There's Jane.

1098
01:09:39,718 --> 01:09:40,719
All right.

1099
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:43,555
Here's the deal, tubby.

1100
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:44,765
You're gonna charm her,

1101
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,099
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1102
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,727
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1103
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,605
I'll be right back, okay?

1104
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,440
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1105
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:56,485
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1106
01:09:56,651 --> 01:09:58,028
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1107
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,946
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1108
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:08,330
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1109
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,414
Yes, milady.

1110
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:10,499
And ask our librarians

1111
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:13,418
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1112
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,134
Who's the fancy broad?

1113
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:23,970
That's my mother.

1114
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,181
She dies today.

1115
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,642
That is today?

1116
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,734
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1117
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,861
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1118
01:10:40,028 --> 01:10:41,154
It's a bad idea!

1119
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,489
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1120
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,075
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1121
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,159
Come here. Right here.

1122
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:47,244
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1123
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:49,746
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1124
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,665
What do you think
we're doing here?

1125
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:54,000
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1126
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,586
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1127
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,171
all gone.

1128
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,215
I get you miss your mom...

1129
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,716
but she's gone.

1130
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:02,884
Really gone.

1131
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,304
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1132
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,597
and you can help them.

1133
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,225
So, is it too much to ask

1134
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,935
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1135
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,396
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1136
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:17,732
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1137
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,484
and help me get my family back?

1138
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,154
Okay.

1139
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:23,447
Are you crying?

1140
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,365
No.

1141
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,368
Yes.

1142
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:29,744
I feel like I'm losing it.

1143
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:30,912
Get it together!

1144
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,914
You can do this.

1145
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:34,583
You can do this.

1146
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,753
All right?

1147
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,921
Yes, I can.

1148
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:41,089
Good.

1149
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,635
I can do this. I can do this.

1150
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,929
I can't do this.

1151
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:49,973
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1152
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,516
This is our shot.

1153
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:54,269
Thor? Thor!

1154
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:05,906
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1155
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,492
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1156
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:14,831
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1157
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,083
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1158
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,002
All that is really helpful.

1159
01:12:21,213 --> 01:12:22,714
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1160
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:25,342
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1161
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:27,552
- Hey.
- We got this.

1162
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:28,929
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,388
I'll see you back.

1164
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,432
You guys watch each other's six.

1165
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,351
Yeah.

1166
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,569
Coordinates for Vormir
are laid in.

1167
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,114
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1168
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,414
We're a long way from Budapest.

1169
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,796
Okay, so...

1170
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:07,259
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1171
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,261
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1172
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,680
Let's take cover.

1173
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,767
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1174
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,269
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about right now?

1175
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,687
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1176
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,733
My father...

1177
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,694
my sister...

1178
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,987
and me.

1179
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,321
And you?

1180
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,783
Where are you right now?

1181
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:01,646
You're welcome.

1182
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:04,107
I didn't ask for your help.

1183
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:06,401
And yet, you always need it.

1184
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,449
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1185
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:13,617
Why?

1186
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:15,785
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1187
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,750
Where?

1188
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,668
On a planet called Morag.

1189
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:27,213
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1190
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,382
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1191
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:30,759
It's a start.

1192
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,719
If he gets all of them...

1193
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:47,484
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

1194
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,277
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1195
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,654
He won't like that.

1196
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,947
His alternative is death.

1197
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:56,201
Ronan's obsession...

1198
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,412
clouds his judgment.

1199
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,627
We will not fail you, Father.

1200
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,296
No, you won't.

1201
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,008
I swear...

1202
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,804
I will make you proud.

1203
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:27,857
...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1204
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,026
and then he leads us to
the Power Stone, is that it?

1205
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:31,778
Let's take cover.

1206
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:35,657
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1207
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:39,536
Who was that?

1208
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:40,787
I don't know.

1209
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,039
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1210
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:47,460
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1211
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,764
Bring her to my ship.

1212
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,231
Better hustle, Cap.

1213
01:16:08,398 --> 01:16:10,483
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1214
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,277
Got it. I'm
approaching the elevator now.

1215
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:20,326
If it's all the same to you...

1216
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,164
I'll have that drink now.

1217
01:16:24,706 --> 01:16:26,166
All right, get him on his feet.

1218
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,335
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1219
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:30,837
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

1220
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:34,007
Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

1221
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:35,884
did nothing for your ass.

1222
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,343
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1223
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:38,428
It's ridiculous.

1224
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,637
I think you look great, Cap.

1225
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:42,140
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

1226
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,184
Who gets the magic wand?

1227
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,477
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1228
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:46,728
coming to secure it.

1229
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,406
We can take that off your hands.

1230
01:16:58,573 --> 01:16:59,574
By all means.

1231
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,536
Careful with that thing.

1232
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,163
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1233
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:06,331
And not in a fun way.

1234
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,457
We promise to be careful.

1235
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,666
Who are these guys?

1236
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,126
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1237
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:13,379
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1238
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:15,715
Seriously?
You didn't?

1239
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,383
I mean, they look like bad guys.

1240
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,968
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1241
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,970
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1242
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,097
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1243
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,725
I mean, honestly, how do you
keep your food down?

1244
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:27,310
Shut up.

1245
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,187
All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1246
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:31,481
There's our stone.

1247
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,649
All right.

1248
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:33,983
Flick me.

1249
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:49,165
- Move.
- Hey.

1250
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,000
Hey, hey. Buddy!

1251
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,961
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

1252
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,128
Take the stairs.

1253
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,880
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1254
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:02,303
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1255
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,809
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1256
01:18:07,976 --> 01:18:09,769
just passing the 80th floor.

1257
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:11,563
On it.

1258
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,147
Head to the lobby.

1259
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:14,274
All right, I'll see you there.

1260
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:16,234
Evidence secure.

1261
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:17,819
We're en route to Doctor List.

1262
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:21,406
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1263
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:27,579
Captain.

1264
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:28,788
I thought you were coordinating

1265
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:29,873
search and rescue.

1266
01:18:29,956 --> 01:18:31,499
Change of plans.

1267
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,754
Hey, Cap.

1268
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,090
Rumlow.

1269
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,223
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1270
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,267
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1271
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:54,022
Sir?
I don't understand.

1272
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:58,318
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1273
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,069
Sorry, Cap.

1274
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,654
We can't give you the scepter.

1275
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,115
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1276
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:06,409
That's okay. Trust me.

1277
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:10,914
Hail Hydra.

1278
01:19:25,637 --> 01:19:27,513
So many stairs!

1279
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,861
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1280
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:43,112
It is go time.

1281
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:44,280
Bombs away.

1282
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,915
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1283
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:56,376
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1284
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:57,543
Can we focus, please?

1285
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:58,962
I'm going inside you...

1286
01:19:59,671 --> 01:20:00,672
now.

1287
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:08,096
May I ask you
where you're going?

1288
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:10,515
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1289
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:11,683
Alexander Pierce.

1290
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,059
He's the man above the folks

1291
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,310
behind Nick Fury.

1292
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:15,603
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1293
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:16,688
I'm gonna have to ask you

1294
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:18,064
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1295
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,024
Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1296
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:21,192
No, he's going to answer to us.

1297
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,568
Odin can have what's left.

1298
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,195
And I'm gonna need that case.

1299
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:26,155
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1300
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:27,323
Hand over the case, Stark.

1301
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:28,866
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1302
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,159
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1303
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:31,953
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1304
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,705
You promise me you won't die?

1305
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,582
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1306
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,334
That doesn't sound mild.

1307
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,502
I need the case.

1308
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,962
I know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1309
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,380
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

1310
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:43,548
Well, jurisdiction...

1311
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:44,632
Hand it over.

1312
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:45,717
Do it, Lang!

1313
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,801
Get your hands off me.

1314
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,344
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1315
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:50,054
Here goes!

1316
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,434
- Stark?
- Stark?

1317
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:56,936
He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1318
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,730
- Medic!
- Medic!

1319
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:00,648
Give these guys some help.

1320
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:02,400
Speak to me.

1321
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,277
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1322
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,364
Breathe, breathe.

1323
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,871
Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1324
01:21:14,954 --> 01:21:15,955
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1325
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:23,379
No stairs!

1326
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,889
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1327
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:33,973
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

1328
01:21:34,057 --> 01:21:35,183
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1329
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,019
Yes!

1330
01:21:38,186 --> 01:21:39,562
That worked a treat.

1331
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:40,730
Dude, that was so crazy.

1332
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:42,273
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1333
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,317
- The case.
- The case is...

1334
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:46,486
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1335
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:48,488
Loki!

1336
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,031
That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?

1337
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,199
We blew it.

1338
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:52,784
Loki?

1339
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,120
Tony, what's going on?

1340
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,790
Tell me you found that Cube.

1341
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,086
You gotta be shitting me.

1342
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,383
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1343
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,927
I'm not Loki...

1344
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,140
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1345
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:26,067
I can do this all day.

1346
01:22:26,234 --> 01:22:27,527
Yeah, I know.

1347
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:28,694
I know.

1348
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:02,436
Where did you get this?

1349
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,784
Bucky is alive.

1350
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,372
What?

1351
01:23:36,304 --> 01:23:37,847
That is America's ass.

1352
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,311
Please, please.

1353
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,271
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1354
01:23:46,314 --> 01:23:47,648
If I give up the Time Stone

1355
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:49,442
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1356
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:51,360
With all due respect,
all right...

1357
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:54,614
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1358
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:02,205
The Infinity Stones create

1359
01:24:02,288 --> 01:24:04,540
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1360
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,250
Remove one of the stones...

1361
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:08,502
and that flow splits.

1362
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:11,130
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1363
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,424
but my new one, not so much.

1364
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,509
In this new branch reality...

1365
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,345
without our chief weapon

1366
01:24:17,428 --> 01:24:18,763
against the forces
of darkness...

1367
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:21,098
our world would be overrun.

1368
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,975
Millions will suffer.

1369
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:24,393
So, tell me, Doctor.

1370
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:27,146
Can your science
prevent all that?

1371
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:28,314
No...

1372
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,441
but we can erase it.

1373
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,318
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1374
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,654
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1375
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,322
at the moment it was taken.

1376
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:38,950
So, chronologically...

1377
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,035
in that reality...

1378
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:45,289
it never left.

1379
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,753
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1380
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,801
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1381
01:24:56,968 --> 01:24:59,553
We will. I will. I promise.

1382
01:25:00,388 --> 01:25:02,431
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1383
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,852
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1384
01:25:06,936 --> 01:25:08,729
to protect the Time Stone.

1385
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:10,982
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1386
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,026
What did you say?

1387
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,529
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1388
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,739
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1389
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,328
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1390
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,163
Maybe he made a mistake.

1391
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:37,591
Or I did.

1392
01:25:57,862 --> 01:26:00,281
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1393
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,950
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1394
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,369
I fear you might be right.

1395
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:11,542
Thank you.

1396
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:19,467
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1397
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,720
We all are.

1398
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,742
Run diagnostics.

1399
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:47,453
Show me her memory file.

1400
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,499
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1401
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,627
It was a memory, but not hers.

1402
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:57,296
There's another consciousness...

1403
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:58,756
sharing her network.

1404
01:26:59,298 --> 01:27:00,633
Another Nebula.

1405
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,220
Impossible.

1406
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:07,014
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1407
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,101
from nine years in the future.

1408
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,191
Where is this other Nebula?

1409
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:19,860
In our solar system on Morag.

1410
01:27:21,404 --> 01:27:22,696
Can you access her?

1411
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,907
Yes, the two are linked.

1412
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,159
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1413
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:29,537
for Infinity Stones.

1414
01:27:33,082 --> 01:27:34,250
And these stones have been

1415
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,043
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1416
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:37,294
Our history.

1417
01:27:37,378 --> 01:27:39,505
So, not a lot
of convenient spots

1418
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:40,798
to just drop in.

1419
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:42,633
Which means
we have to pick our targets.

1420
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,093
- Correct.
- Freeze image.

1421
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,263
Terrans.

1422
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,015
Avengers.

1423
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,810
Unruly wretches.

1424
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:54,478
What's that reflection?

1425
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:57,273
Amplify this, Maw.

1426
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:01,986
I don't understand.

1427
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:08,284
Two Nebulas.

1428
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:10,870
No.
The same Nebula...

1429
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,414
from two different times.

1430
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,333
Set course for Morag.

1431
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,878
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1432
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,006
I wanna see everything.

1433
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:33,851
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1434
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,352
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1435
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:50,743
What are you doing?

1436
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,579
Oh, God!

1437
01:28:53,746 --> 01:28:56,207
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1438
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,209
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1439
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,710
What are you wearing?

1440
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,254
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1441
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:07,718
What's wrong with your eye?

1442
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:08,886
My eye.

1443
01:29:09,053 --> 01:29:11,013
Remember the
Battle of Harokin...

1444
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,431
when I got hit in the face

1445
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:14,266
with the broadsword?

1446
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,813
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1447
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:22,316
Yes, I am.

1448
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:25,319
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1449
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:27,696
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1450
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:30,699
I was raised by witches, boy.

1451
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:34,119
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1452
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:38,457
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1453
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:40,251
Yes, you are, honey.

1454
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:41,919
I really need to talk to you.

1455
01:29:42,086 --> 01:29:43,087
We can talk.

1456
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,196
His head was over there...

1457
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,324
and his body over there...

1458
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,120
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1459
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:18,414
I was just standing there.

1460
01:30:19,373 --> 01:30:21,125
Some idiot with an axe.

1461
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:23,002
Now, you're no idiot.

1462
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,713
You're here, aren't you?

1463
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:28,382
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1464
01:30:28,716 --> 01:30:29,758
I am. Yes.

1465
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,260
Idiot, no.

1466
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:32,928
A failure?

1467
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:34,221
Absolutely.

1468
01:30:34,388 --> 01:30:36,181
That's a little bit harsh.

1469
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,850
Do you know what that makes you?

1470
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,061
Just like everyone else.

1471
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:43,314
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1472
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:47,776
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1473
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:51,530
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1474
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:55,075
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1475
01:31:00,331 --> 01:31:01,790
I've really missed you, Mom.

1476
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:09,423
Thor! I got it!

1477
01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,842
Get that rabbit!

1478
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,430
Mom, I have to tell you
something.

1479
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:18,390
No, son, you don't.

1480
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:21,060
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1481
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:22,895
This is about your future.

1482
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,396
It's none of my business.

1483
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,652
Hi.

1484
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:31,820
You must be Mom.

1485
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:33,447
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1486
01:31:33,614 --> 01:31:35,074
I wish we had more time.

1487
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,076
No, this was a gift.

1488
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:40,663
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1489
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:43,290
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1490
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:49,672
And eat a salad.

1491
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:51,799
Come on, we gotta go.

1492
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:53,550
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1493
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:54,802
- Two...
- No, wait!

1494
01:31:58,055 --> 01:31:59,264
What am I looking at?

1495
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:00,891
Sometimes it takes a second.

1496
01:32:10,359 --> 01:32:12,403
I'm still worthy.

1497
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:15,447
Boy.

1498
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:18,534
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1499
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,408
So, he's an idiot?

1500
01:33:00,743 --> 01:33:02,161
Yeah.

1501
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:11,879
What's that?

1502
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:13,922
The tool of a thief.

1503
01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:25,309
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1504
01:33:25,476 --> 01:33:26,977
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1505
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,270
What are you talking about?

1506
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:29,480
When you break into
a place called

1507
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:30,773
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1508
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,232
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1509
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:34,651
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1510
01:34:07,935 --> 01:34:09,436
I wasn't always like this.

1511
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:11,355
Me either.

1512
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:14,608
But we work
with what we got, right?

1513
01:34:18,362 --> 01:34:20,030
Let's sync up.

1514
01:34:21,907 --> 01:34:24,368
Three, two, one.

1515
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:38,841
You murdered trillions!

1516
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,300
You should be grateful.

1517
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:43,637
Where are the stones?

1518
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:44,805
Gone.

1519
01:34:45,556 --> 01:34:46,557
Reduced to atoms.

1520
01:34:47,266 --> 01:34:48,934
You used them two days ago!

1521
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:52,229
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

1522
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:54,231
It nearly killed me.

1523
01:34:54,398 --> 01:34:56,316
But the work is done.

1524
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:58,318
It always will be.

1525
01:34:59,611 --> 01:35:03,073
I am inevitable.

1526
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,368
What did you do to them?

1527
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:07,786
Nothing.

1528
01:35:08,662 --> 01:35:09,955
Yet.

1529
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,667
They're not trying
to stop something

1530
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,460
I'm going to do in our time.

1531
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:17,796
They're trying to undo something

1532
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:19,423
I've already done in theirs.

1533
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,258
The stones.

1534
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:24,094
I found them all.

1535
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:27,264
I won.

1536
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:30,976
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1537
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,732
This is your future.

1538
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,109
It's my destiny.

1539
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:42,362
My father is many things.

1540
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:44,364
A liar is not one of them.

1541
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:49,995
Thank you, daughter.

1542
01:35:50,162 --> 01:35:52,331
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

1543
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:59,713
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1544
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,506
Sire...

1545
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:02,799
your daughter...

1546
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,261
No!

1547
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,763
...is a traitor.

1548
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:10,390
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1549
01:36:10,557 --> 01:36:11,725
I would never betray you.

1550
01:36:11,892 --> 01:36:13,727
Never. Never.

1551
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:20,651
I know.

1552
01:36:21,610 --> 01:36:24,863
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1553
01:36:31,161 --> 01:36:32,245
No!

1554
01:36:32,955 --> 01:36:34,164
He knows!

1555
01:36:38,752 --> 01:36:40,796
Barton! Barton, come in.

1556
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:42,714
Romanoff!

1557
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:44,758
Come in, we have a problem.

1558
01:36:44,925 --> 01:36:46,051
Come on!

1559
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:47,636
Come in, we have a...

1560
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:49,137
Thanos knows.

1561
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:51,056
Thanos...

1562
01:37:04,778 --> 01:37:05,862
Cap.

1563
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:09,741
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1564
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,910
Yeah, we do.

1565
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:13,578
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1566
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:14,746
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1567
01:37:14,830 --> 01:37:16,206
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1568
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:17,833
You said that we had one shot.

1569
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,334
This was our shot.

1570
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:21,503
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1571
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:23,130
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

1572
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:24,214
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1573
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,049
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1574
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:27,134
Dude. Come on!

1575
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:28,218
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1576
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:29,302
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1577
01:37:29,386 --> 01:37:30,595
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1578
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:32,055
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1579
01:37:32,139 --> 01:37:33,932
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1580
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,308
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1581
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:36,727
There's no do-overs.

1582
01:37:36,893 --> 01:37:38,937
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1583
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,022
Each.

1584
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:42,441
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1585
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:43,775
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1586
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,902
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1587
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,237
then no one else
is going home, either.

1588
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:48,405
I got it.

1589
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,867
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1590
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,660
and acquire new particles.

1591
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:55,537
Little stroll down memory lane.

1592
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,165
Military installation,
Garden State.

1593
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:03,545
When were they both there?

1594
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:06,089
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1595
01:38:06,757 --> 01:38:07,758
- How vague?
- What are you

1596
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:08,884
talking about?
Where are we going?

1597
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:09,968
I know for a fact
they were there.

1598
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:11,053
Who's they? What are we doing?

1599
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:12,220
And I know how I know.

1600
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:15,682
Guys, what is it?

1601
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:17,893
Looks like we're improvising.

1602
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,269
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1603
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:21,104
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1604
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:22,272
Suit up.

1605
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:23,940
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1606
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:25,025
0-4.

1607
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:26,234
- 0-7.
- 0-7.

1608
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:28,195
- Excuse me.
- 1 -9-7-0.

1609
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:29,654
Are you sure?

1610
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:31,031
Cap? Captain?

1611
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:33,033
Steve? Sorry.

1612
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,826
America. Rogers.

1613
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,203
Look, if you do this...

1614
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:39,039
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1615
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,917
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1616
01:38:42,959 --> 01:38:44,169
You trust me?

1617
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:46,213
I do.

1618
01:38:47,255 --> 01:38:48,590
Your call.

1619
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:51,176
Here we go.

1620
01:39:07,234 --> 01:39:10,862
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1621
01:39:16,785 --> 01:39:19,454
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1622
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:21,123
The idea of me was.

1623
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:23,834
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1624
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,254
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1625
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:30,173
where do you hide it?

1626
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,008
In plain sight.

1627
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:01,538
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1628
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:04,249
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1629
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:08,753
You new here?

1630
01:40:11,298 --> 01:40:12,632
Not exactly.

1631
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:21,141
Come on, you bastard.

1632
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,441
Gotcha.

1633
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,627
Back in the game.

1634
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,505
Arnim, you in there?

1635
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:54,507
Arnim?

1636
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,139
Hey!

1637
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:03,516
The door is this way, pal.

1638
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:05,393
Yeah.

1639
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,437
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1640
01:41:07,604 --> 01:41:11,024
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1641
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:13,860
Pardon me.

1642
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:16,238
Do I know you?

1643
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:18,490
No, sir.

1644
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:21,743
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1645
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:23,453
MIT.

1646
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:25,038
Got a name?

1647
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:26,623
Howard.

1648
01:41:26,790 --> 01:41:29,292
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1649
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:31,294
Potts.

1650
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:34,089
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1651
01:41:34,256 --> 01:41:35,257
Hi.

1652
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:36,633
Shake that, don't pull it.

1653
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,801
Yeah.

1654
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:41,429
You look a little green around
the gills, there, Potts.

1655
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,765
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1656
01:41:43,932 --> 01:41:45,642
You wanna get some air?

1657
01:41:48,186 --> 01:41:49,980
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1658
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:51,398
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1659
01:41:51,564 --> 01:41:52,565
Okay.

1660
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:54,359
Need your briefcase?

1661
01:41:58,697 --> 01:42:01,283
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1662
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:08,915
- Hello?
- Doctor Pym?

1663
01:42:09,082 --> 01:42:11,293
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1664
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:13,712
This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.

1665
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:15,005
We have a package for you.

1666
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:16,548
Bring it up.

1667
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:18,675
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1668
01:42:19,801 --> 01:42:22,429
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1669
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:23,972
Well, it's just...

1670
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:25,598
Sir, the box is glowing...

1671
01:42:25,765 --> 01:42:26,766
and to be honest,

1672
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,560
some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1673
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:30,437
They didn't open it, did they?

1674
01:42:30,603 --> 01:42:32,772
Yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1675
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:35,525
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1676
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,222
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1677
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:08,433
My wife's expecting.

1678
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,436
And too much time at the office.

1679
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,647
Congratulations.

1680
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,941
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1681
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:20,111
- How far along is she?
- I don't know.

1682
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:23,031
She's at the point where

1683
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:24,657
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1684
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:28,286
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1685
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:30,205
I have a little girl.

1686
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:31,873
A girl would be nice.

1687
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:34,042
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1688
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:36,169
What'd be so awful about that?

1689
01:43:36,336 --> 01:43:38,338
Let's just say
that the greater good

1690
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:41,716
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1691
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:46,930
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1692
01:43:47,013 --> 01:43:48,807
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1693
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:49,974
Can you describe them?

1694
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:51,226
One of them had a hippie beard.

1695
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:53,561
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1696
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:54,771
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1697
01:43:54,938 --> 01:43:55,939
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1698
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:57,190
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1699
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:59,150
We have a potential breach.

1700
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,044
I said bring them in.

1701
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:19,212
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1702
01:44:19,295 --> 01:44:20,296
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1703
01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:21,423
For the love of...

1704
01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:23,007
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1705
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,033
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1706
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:02,088
So, where you at with names?

1707
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:05,383
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1708
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,510
Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1709
01:45:07,594 --> 01:45:09,053
You got time.

1710
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,931
Let me ask you a question.

1711
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:16,186
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1712
01:45:16,352 --> 01:45:17,854
Wildly.

1713
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:19,647
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1714
01:45:19,814 --> 01:45:21,691
Like you had any idea

1715
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,401
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1716
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:26,654
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1717
01:45:26,821 --> 01:45:28,823
I thought about what my dad did.

1718
01:45:29,282 --> 01:45:30,533
My old man,

1719
01:45:30,617 --> 01:45:32,410
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1720
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:34,537
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1721
01:45:34,704 --> 01:45:36,039
And now, looking back on it,

1722
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:37,415
I just remember the good stuff.

1723
01:45:37,582 --> 01:45:39,167
You know?
He did drop the odd pearl.

1724
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:40,710
Yeah? Like what?

1725
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:44,339
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1726
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:46,716
Smart guy.

1727
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,593
He did his best.

1728
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,471
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1729
01:45:51,554 --> 01:45:53,932
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1730
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:04,067
Good to meet you, Potts.

1731
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:05,568
Yeah.

1732
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:07,153
Howard...

1733
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:09,322
everything's gonna be all right.

1734
01:46:12,325 --> 01:46:13,576
Thank you...

1735
01:46:14,536 --> 01:46:15,870
for everything...

1736
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:18,581
you've done for this country.

1737
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:22,585
Jarvis.

1738
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:27,840
Have we ever met that guy?

1739
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:31,344
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1740
01:46:33,972 --> 01:46:35,598
Seems very familiar.

1741
01:46:36,516 --> 01:46:37,976
Weird beard.

1742
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:47,318
You're weak.

1743
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:48,945
I'm you.

1744
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:08,673
You could stop this.

1745
01:47:08,965 --> 01:47:10,758
You know you want to.

1746
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:13,636
Did you see
what happens in the future?

1747
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:17,307
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1748
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,852
You wanna know how he does that?

1749
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:26,399
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1750
01:47:26,899 --> 01:47:27,900
That's enough.

1751
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:42,165
You disgust me.

1752
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:48,338
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1753
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:11,736
How do I look?

1754
01:48:20,328 --> 01:48:23,456
Under different circumstances...

1755
01:48:23,623 --> 01:48:25,625
this would be totally awesome.

1756
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:38,930
I bet the raccoon

1757
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,598
didn't have to climb a mountain.

1758
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,684
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1759
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:44,394
Whatever.
He eats garbage.

1760
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,895
Welcome.

1761
01:48:49,065 --> 01:48:50,400
Natasha.

1762
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:51,567
Daughter of Ivan.

1763
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:54,028
Clint.

1764
01:48:54,195 --> 01:48:56,489
Son of Edith.

1765
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,329
Who are you?

1766
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:06,416
Consider me a guide...

1767
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:08,251
to you...

1768
01:49:08,418 --> 01:49:10,253
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1769
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,462
Good.

1770
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,756
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1771
01:49:17,677 --> 01:49:19,929
If only it were that easy.

1772
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:35,737
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1773
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:39,407
As does what you fear.

1774
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:46,205
The stone's down there.

1775
01:49:46,831 --> 01:49:48,750
For one of you.

1776
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:50,752
For the other...

1777
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:55,339
In order to take the stone...

1778
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:58,509
you must lose
that which you love.

1779
01:49:59,886 --> 01:50:03,055
An everlasting exchange.

1780
01:50:04,056 --> 01:50:08,144
A soul for a soul.

1781
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:13,316
How's it going?

1782
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:16,944
Jesus.

1783
01:50:17,278 --> 01:50:18,988
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1784
01:50:19,864 --> 01:50:21,199
No.

1785
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,034
I don't think so.

1786
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:25,912
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1787
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:28,456
I didn't.

1788
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:32,335
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1789
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,545
without his daughter.

1790
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,798
That's not a coincidence.

1791
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:39,509
Yeah.

1792
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:43,095
Whatever it takes.

1793
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,101
Whatever it takes.

1794
01:50:53,481 --> 01:50:55,441
If we don't get that stone...

1795
01:50:55,608 --> 01:50:57,276
billions of people stay dead.

1796
01:50:58,152 --> 01:50:59,320
Yeah.

1797
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:03,324
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1798
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,243
I guess we do.

1799
01:51:13,668 --> 01:51:15,795
I'm starting to think we mean

1800
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:18,381
different people here, Natasha.

1801
01:51:18,881 --> 01:51:20,716
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1802
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,134
Get to right here.

1803
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,303
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1804
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:26,681
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1805
01:51:26,848 --> 01:51:28,850
What, you think I wanna do it?

1806
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:31,185
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1807
01:51:31,352 --> 01:51:33,688
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1808
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,816
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1809
01:51:38,484 --> 01:51:40,278
You know what I've become.

1810
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:44,991
I don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1811
01:51:49,161 --> 01:51:50,413
Maybe you should.

1812
01:51:51,289 --> 01:51:52,832
You didn't.

1813
01:51:59,005 --> 01:52:01,215
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1814
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:13,519
Okay.

1815
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:16,772
You win.

1816
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:24,405
Tell my family I love 'em.

1817
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:29,327
You tell 'em yourself.

1818
01:53:02,193 --> 01:53:03,194
Damn you.

1819
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:11,702
Wait.

1820
01:53:19,752 --> 01:53:21,587
Let me go.

1821
01:53:22,838 --> 01:53:23,839
No.

1822
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:26,592
No. Please, no.

1823
01:53:29,971 --> 01:53:31,806
It's okay.

1824
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:34,850
Please.

1825
01:53:36,936 --> 01:53:37,937
No!

1826
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:20,414
Did we get 'em all?

1827
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,626
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1828
01:55:28,464 --> 01:55:29,673
Clint, where's Nat?

1829
01:55:58,911 --> 01:55:59,912
Do we know if she had family?

1830
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,248
Yeah.

1831
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:03,415
Us.

1832
01:56:04,834 --> 01:56:05,876
What?

1833
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:09,088
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1834
01:56:09,171 --> 01:56:10,422
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1835
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:11,715
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1836
01:56:11,799 --> 01:56:13,050
We have the stones, right?

1837
01:56:13,217 --> 01:56:14,218
As long as we have the stones...

1838
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:16,137
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1839
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:18,305
So, stop this shit. We're the
Avengers. Get it together.

1840
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:19,682
Can't get her back.

1841
01:56:22,685 --> 01:56:23,936
What's he...?
What?

1842
01:56:24,103 --> 01:56:25,312
It can't be undone.

1843
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,606
It can't.

1844
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:31,485
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

1845
01:56:31,569 --> 01:56:33,237
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1846
01:56:33,404 --> 01:56:34,697
And we're talking
about space magic.

1847
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:36,866
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

1848
01:56:37,032 --> 01:56:38,409
Yeah, look,
I know that I'm way outside

1849
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:39,869
my pay grade here.

1850
01:56:40,035 --> 01:56:41,495
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1851
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:42,663
No, that's my point.

1852
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:45,791
It can't be undone.

1853
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,376
Or that's at least

1854
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:49,295
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1855
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,921
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1856
01:56:51,088 --> 01:56:54,133
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1857
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:04,727
It was supposed to be me.

1858
01:57:06,979 --> 01:57:09,273
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1859
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,900
She bet her life on it.

1860
01:57:15,821 --> 01:57:18,157
She's not coming back.

1861
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,410
We have to make it worth it.

1862
01:57:21,994 --> 01:57:23,454
We have to.

1863
01:57:24,872 --> 01:57:26,540
We will.

1864
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,358
Boom!

1865
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:59,490
All right, the glove's ready.

1866
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:02,868
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1867
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:05,120
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1868
01:58:05,246 --> 01:58:06,288
It's okay.

1869
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:07,373
Stop, stop. Slow down.

1870
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:08,958
Thor. Just wait.

1871
01:58:09,124 --> 01:58:10,960
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1872
01:58:11,335 --> 01:58:12,920
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

1873
01:58:13,003 --> 01:58:14,255
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1874
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,547
We should at least discuss it.

1875
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:17,675
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1876
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:19,551
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1877
01:58:20,594 --> 01:58:22,096
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

1878
01:58:22,179 --> 01:58:23,514
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1879
01:58:23,681 --> 01:58:24,890
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1880
01:58:25,057 --> 01:58:26,850
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1881
01:58:27,017 --> 01:58:28,811
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1882
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:33,315
Just let me do it.

1883
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:35,985
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1884
01:58:36,151 --> 01:58:37,152
Look, it's not just the fact...

1885
01:58:37,319 --> 01:58:38,445
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1886
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:39,446
to light up a continent.

1887
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:41,615
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1888
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:44,827
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1889
01:58:44,994 --> 01:58:46,036
Cheez Whiz?

1890
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:49,581
Lightning.

1891
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:50,874
- Yeah.
- Lightning.

1892
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:52,418
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1893
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:54,420
It's gotta be me.

1894
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,923
You saw what those stones
did to Thanos.

1895
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,633
They almost killed him.

1896
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:02,928
None of you could survive.

1897
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:05,264
How do we know you will?

1898
01:59:05,431 --> 01:59:06,473
We don't.

1899
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:09,310
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1900
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:14,398
It's like...

1901
01:59:16,275 --> 01:59:18,193
I was made for this.

1902
01:59:37,129 --> 01:59:38,630
Good to go, yeah?

1903
01:59:40,758 --> 01:59:41,759
Let's do it.

1904
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,302
Okay, remember,

1905
01:59:43,385 --> 01:59:44,970
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1906
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:47,598
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1907
01:59:47,765 --> 01:59:49,183
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1908
01:59:50,601 --> 01:59:51,769
Got it.

1909
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:09,411
Friday, do me a favor

1910
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:10,954
and activate
Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1911
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:12,414
Yes, boss.

1912
02:00:21,006 --> 02:00:22,841
Everybody comes home.

1913
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,658
Take it off! Take it off!

1914
02:00:47,825 --> 02:00:48,951
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1915
02:00:49,034 --> 02:00:51,328
Talk to me, Banner.

1916
02:00:54,498 --> 02:00:55,499
I'm okay.

1917
02:00:55,999 --> 02:00:57,292
I'm okay.

1918
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:29,867
Bruce!

1919
02:01:31,618 --> 02:01:33,203
Don't move him.

1920
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:42,087
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1921
02:02:28,592 --> 02:02:29,468
Honey.

1922
02:02:29,635 --> 02:02:30,594
Clint?

1923
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:32,012
Honey.

1924
02:02:32,846 --> 02:02:34,181
Guys...

1925
02:02:36,642 --> 02:02:38,018
I think it worked.

1926
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:22,521
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1927
02:03:23,772 --> 02:03:25,566
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1928
02:03:32,197 --> 02:03:33,991
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

1929
02:03:35,158 --> 02:03:36,702
Let me up! Let me up!

1930
02:03:37,452 --> 02:03:38,203
Come on!

1931
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:49,172
Rhodey!

1932
02:03:57,723 --> 02:03:59,433
Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?

1933
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:00,767
We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!

1934
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:02,644
What? What?

1935
02:04:02,811 --> 02:04:04,980
We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1936
02:04:05,147 --> 02:04:07,316
Wait! I'm here!

1937
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:08,984
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1938
02:04:28,629 --> 02:04:29,838
Cap?

1939
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:54,946
Okay.

1940
02:05:14,216 --> 02:05:15,342
Daughter.

1941
02:05:15,509 --> 02:05:16,677
Yes, Father.

1942
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:20,263
So, this is the future.

1943
02:05:20,931 --> 02:05:21,765
Well done.

1944
02:05:22,683 --> 02:05:24,184
Thank you, Father.

1945
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:25,727
They suspected nothing.

1946
02:05:28,063 --> 02:05:29,523
The arrogant never do.

1947
02:05:32,484 --> 02:05:33,610
Go.

1948
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,988
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1949
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:38,865
What will you do?

1950
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,868
Wait.

1951
02:06:07,102 --> 02:06:08,770
Tell me something.

1952
02:06:09,896 --> 02:06:12,315
In the future...

1953
02:06:12,482 --> 02:06:14,359
what happens to you and me?

1954
02:06:16,653 --> 02:06:18,280
I try to kill you.

1955
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:21,491
Several times.

1956
02:06:22,576 --> 02:06:24,536
But eventually...

1957
02:06:24,703 --> 02:06:26,663
we become friends.

1958
02:06:28,165 --> 02:06:29,875
We become sisters.

1959
02:06:37,549 --> 02:06:38,759
Come on.

1960
02:06:40,802 --> 02:06:42,596
We can stop him.

1961
02:06:50,687 --> 02:06:52,022
Come on, buddy, wake up!

1962
02:06:52,105 --> 02:06:54,024
That's my man.

1963
02:06:54,941 --> 02:06:56,985
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1964
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:01,698
What happened?

1965
02:07:01,865 --> 02:07:03,992
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1966
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:05,035
You'll see.

1967
02:07:27,140 --> 02:07:28,517
What's he been doing?

1968
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:31,853
Absolutely nothing.

1969
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:35,482
Where are the stones?

1970
02:07:35,857 --> 02:07:37,692
Somewhere under all this.

1971
02:07:39,069 --> 02:07:41,279
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1972
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:43,198
So, we keep it that way.

1973
02:07:43,365 --> 02:07:44,741
You know it's a trap, right?

1974
02:07:44,908 --> 02:07:46,243
Yeah.

1975
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:47,744
I don't much care.

1976
02:07:48,495 --> 02:07:49,496
Good.

1977
02:07:50,455 --> 02:07:52,958
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

1978
02:08:02,717 --> 02:08:04,719
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1979
02:08:14,104 --> 02:08:17,023
You could not live
with your own failure.

1980
02:08:18,525 --> 02:08:20,360
Where did that bring you?

1981
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,198
Back to me.

1982
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:31,454
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

1983
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:34,583
the other half would thrive.

1984
02:08:34,749 --> 02:08:36,084
But you've shown me...

1985
02:08:37,252 --> 02:08:39,004
that's impossible.

1986
02:08:40,922 --> 02:08:44,217
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

1987
02:08:44,384 --> 02:08:45,886
there will always be those

1988
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:49,598
that are unable to accept
what can be.

1989
02:08:50,348 --> 02:08:51,600
They will resist.

1990
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:54,019
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

1991
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,521
I'm thankful.

1992
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:00,442
Because now...

1993
02:09:00,609 --> 02:09:02,736
I know what I must do.

1994
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:06,156
I will shred this universe...

1995
02:09:06,323 --> 02:09:08,366
down to its last atom.

1996
02:09:09,159 --> 02:09:10,827
And then...

1997
02:09:10,994 --> 02:09:13,330
with the stones
you've collected for me...

1998
02:09:14,122 --> 02:09:16,249
create a new one...

1999
02:09:16,416 --> 02:09:18,627
teeming with life...

2000
02:09:18,793 --> 02:09:20,670
that knows not
what it has lost...

2001
02:09:20,837 --> 02:09:23,214
but only what it has been given.

2002
02:09:26,301 --> 02:09:27,719
A grateful universe.

2003
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:29,679
Born out of blood.

2004
02:09:29,846 --> 02:09:31,514
They'll never know it.

2005
02:09:32,724 --> 02:09:35,644
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2006
02:09:50,241 --> 02:09:51,534
See you on the other side, man.

2007
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:55,872
Hang on! I'm coming!

2008
02:10:26,152 --> 02:10:27,153
Yeah!

2009
02:10:42,043 --> 02:10:43,586
Hey.

2010
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,463
I know you.

2011
02:10:48,383 --> 02:10:49,384
Father...

2012
02:10:50,135 --> 02:10:51,553
I have the stones.

2013
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:52,637
What?

2014
02:10:54,014 --> 02:10:54,931
Stop.

2015
02:11:00,145 --> 02:11:01,563
You're betraying us?

2016
02:11:07,569 --> 02:11:08,862
You don't have to do this.

2017
02:11:11,698 --> 02:11:14,200
I am this.

2018
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:16,286
No, you're not.

2019
02:11:16,745 --> 02:11:18,621
You've seen what we become.

2020
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:26,921
Nebula, listen to her.

2021
02:11:28,381 --> 02:11:29,257
You can change.

2022
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:37,432
He won't let me.

2023
02:11:39,059 --> 02:11:39,809
No!

2024
02:11:59,454 --> 02:12:00,830
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2025
02:12:17,472 --> 02:12:18,765
Boss, wake up!

2026
02:13:10,066 --> 02:13:11,359
I knew it!

2027
02:14:33,733 --> 02:14:36,569
In all my years of conquest...

2028
02:14:37,862 --> 02:14:39,614
violence...

2029
02:14:40,657 --> 02:14:42,617
slaughter...

2030
02:14:43,743 --> 02:14:46,162
it was never personal.

2031
02:14:48,748 --> 02:14:50,833
But I'll tell you now...

2032
02:14:52,835 --> 02:14:56,631
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2033
02:14:56,714 --> 02:14:59,092
annoying little planet...

2034
02:15:00,843 --> 02:15:03,054
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2035
02:15:03,972 --> 02:15:06,349
very, very much.

2036
02:16:09,829 --> 02:16:11,372
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2037
02:16:17,378 --> 02:16:19,672
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

2038
02:16:23,676 --> 02:16:25,094
On your left.

2039
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:52,056
Is that everyone?

2040
02:17:52,223 --> 02:17:54,434
What? You wanted more?

2041
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:22,920
Avengers...

2042
02:18:28,050 --> 02:18:29,135
assemble.

2043
02:19:04,337 --> 02:19:05,588
Die!

2044
02:19:26,234 --> 02:19:28,986
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2045
02:19:42,667 --> 02:19:43,501
Hey!

2046
02:19:44,502 --> 02:19:45,503
Holy cow!

2047
02:19:45,670 --> 02:19:47,046
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2048
02:19:47,129 --> 02:19:48,339
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2049
02:19:48,506 --> 02:19:49,882
And I got all dusty?

2050
02:19:50,049 --> 02:19:51,133
And I must've passed out,

2051
02:19:51,217 --> 02:19:52,718
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2052
02:19:52,885 --> 02:19:54,512
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2053
02:19:54,679 --> 02:19:56,180
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2054
02:19:56,347 --> 02:19:57,932
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2055
02:19:58,015 --> 02:19:59,016
- that he does all the time.
- He did? No.

2056
02:19:59,183 --> 02:20:01,519
What are you doing?

2057
02:20:05,523 --> 02:20:07,024
This is nice.

2058
02:20:28,796 --> 02:20:29,797
Gamora?

2059
02:20:39,223 --> 02:20:40,891
I thought I lost you.

2060
02:20:45,479 --> 02:20:48,399
Don't touch me!

2061
02:20:51,402 --> 02:20:53,237
You missed the first time.

2062
02:20:53,404 --> 02:20:55,406
Then you got 'em
both the second time.

2063
02:20:57,408 --> 02:20:58,492
This is the one?

2064
02:20:58,659 --> 02:20:59,660
Seriously?

2065
02:20:59,827 --> 02:21:01,829
Your choices were him or a tree.

2066
02:21:12,632 --> 02:21:13,633
Cap!

2067
02:21:13,799 --> 02:21:15,551
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2068
02:21:18,262 --> 02:21:20,306
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2069
02:21:20,473 --> 02:21:21,515
No!

2070
02:21:22,683 --> 02:21:24,644
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2071
02:21:24,810 --> 02:21:25,811
No way to get 'em back.

2072
02:21:25,895 --> 02:21:27,396
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2073
02:21:27,563 --> 02:21:28,397
Hold on!

2074
02:21:30,274 --> 02:21:32,401
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2075
02:21:38,407 --> 02:21:40,326
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2076
02:21:40,868 --> 02:21:43,954
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2077
02:21:44,121 --> 02:21:46,248
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2078
02:21:47,458 --> 02:21:48,626
Maybe 10 minutes.

2079
02:21:48,793 --> 02:21:50,294
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2080
02:21:50,461 --> 02:21:52,004
We're on it, Cap.

2081
02:22:01,764 --> 02:22:02,890
Hey.

2082
02:22:03,057 --> 02:22:06,060
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2083
02:22:06,977 --> 02:22:07,978
Tell me this is it.

2084
02:22:08,396 --> 02:22:10,272
If I tell you what happens...

2085
02:22:10,439 --> 02:22:11,607
it won't happen.

2086
02:22:15,194 --> 02:22:16,195
You better be right.

2087
02:22:24,620 --> 02:22:25,996
It's a mess back here.

2088
02:22:26,997 --> 02:22:27,998
It's dead.

2089
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:30,793
- What?
- It's dead.

2090
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:32,378
I have to hot-wire it.

2091
02:22:35,464 --> 02:22:36,674
Where's Nebula?

2092
02:22:37,800 --> 02:22:39,135
She's not responding.

2093
02:22:39,510 --> 02:22:40,845
Sire...

2094
02:22:50,604 --> 02:22:51,856
Clint!

2095
02:22:53,899 --> 02:22:55,025
Give it to me.

2096
02:23:17,298 --> 02:23:20,676
You took everything from me.

2097
02:23:21,051 --> 02:23:23,387
I don't even know who you are.

2098
02:23:23,554 --> 02:23:25,181
You will.

2099
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:48,579
I got it!

2100
02:23:51,123 --> 02:23:52,208
Activate Instant Kill.

2101
02:24:15,648 --> 02:24:16,982
Rain fire!

2102
02:24:17,691 --> 02:24:19,610
But, sire, our troops!

2103
02:24:19,777 --> 02:24:21,529
Just do it!

2104
02:24:41,674 --> 02:24:44,051
Is anyone else seeing this?

2105
02:24:57,982 --> 02:24:59,108
I got this!

2106
02:24:59,358 --> 02:25:01,151
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2107
02:25:01,485 --> 02:25:02,653
Help, somebody help!

2108
02:25:02,820 --> 02:25:04,697
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2109
02:25:14,748 --> 02:25:15,791
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2110
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:20,588
Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2111
02:25:20,754 --> 02:25:22,590
Oh, my God!

2112
02:25:58,834 --> 02:26:00,294
What the hell is this?

2113
02:26:01,086 --> 02:26:02,171
Friday, what are they firing at?

2114
02:26:02,338 --> 02:26:04,214
Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.

2115
02:26:17,478 --> 02:26:19,647
Yeah!

2116
02:26:39,541 --> 02:26:41,961
Danvers, we need an assist here.

2117
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:53,305
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2118
02:26:53,931 --> 02:26:55,349
Hey, Peter Parker.

2119
02:26:55,516 --> 02:26:56,684
You got something for me?

2120
02:27:02,815 --> 02:27:04,900
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2121
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:07,987
Don't worry.

2122
02:27:08,862 --> 02:27:10,447
She's got help.

2123
02:29:58,240 --> 02:30:01,743
I am inevitable.

2124
02:30:21,889 --> 02:30:23,432
And I...

2125
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:26,268
am...

2126
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:31,481
Iron Man.

2127
02:32:30,183 --> 02:32:31,893
Mr. Stark?

2128
02:32:32,311 --> 02:32:34,438
Hey!

2129
02:32:34,563 --> 02:32:37,524
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2130
02:32:37,691 --> 02:32:39,234
It's Peter.

2131
02:32:40,527 --> 02:32:42,154
Hey.

2132
02:32:43,196 --> 02:32:46,241
We won, Mr. Stark.

2133
02:32:48,076 --> 02:32:50,245
We won, Mr. Stark.

2134
02:32:51,872 --> 02:32:54,708
We won!
You did it, sir, you did it.

2135
02:32:55,167 --> 02:32:56,918
I'm sorry.

2136
02:32:57,085 --> 02:32:58,086
Tony.

2137
02:33:11,767 --> 02:33:12,809
Hey.

2138
02:33:12,976 --> 02:33:14,811
Hey, Pep.

2139
02:33:19,107 --> 02:33:20,192
Friday?

2140
02:33:20,359 --> 02:33:23,111
Life functions critical.

2141
02:33:31,703 --> 02:33:32,704
Tony?

2142
02:33:33,955 --> 02:33:35,040
Look at me.

2143
02:33:37,709 --> 02:33:39,628
We're gonna be okay.

2144
02:33:44,341 --> 02:33:46,218
You can rest now.

2145
02:35:31,740 --> 02:35:34,534
Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?

2146
02:35:34,701 --> 02:35:36,912
But it doesn't
always roll that way.

2147
02:35:38,997 --> 02:35:40,665
Maybe this time.

2148
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:44,920
I'm hoping
if you play this back...

2149
02:35:46,588 --> 02:35:47,923
it's in celebration.

2150
02:35:49,174 --> 02:35:52,844
I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.

2151
02:35:53,011 --> 02:35:54,596
And something like
a normal version

2152
02:35:54,679 --> 02:35:56,932
of the planet has been restored.

2153
02:35:57,098 --> 02:35:59,059
If there ever was such a thing.

2154
02:35:59,643 --> 02:36:02,646
God, what a world.
Universe, now.

2155
02:36:03,605 --> 02:36:05,607
If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...

2156
02:36:05,774 --> 02:36:07,776
let alone to this extent,
I mean,

2157
02:36:07,859 --> 02:36:09,444
I wouldn't have
been surprised...

2158
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,238
but come on, who knew?

2159
02:36:11,404 --> 02:36:14,199
The epic forces
of darkness and light

2160
02:36:14,282 --> 02:36:16,034
that have come into play.

2161
02:36:16,201 --> 02:36:17,911
And for better or worse...

2162
02:36:18,078 --> 02:36:19,746
that's the reality
Morgan's gonna

2163
02:36:19,829 --> 02:36:22,249
have to find a way
to grow up in.

2164
02:36:25,502 --> 02:36:26,211
So, I thought I'd probably

2165
02:36:26,294 --> 02:36:27,295
better record
a little greeting...

2166
02:36:27,462 --> 02:36:31,091
in the case of an untimely
death. On my part.

2167
02:36:31,258 --> 02:36:34,511
Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.

2168
02:36:35,720 --> 02:36:37,055
This time travel thing
that we're gonna

2169
02:36:37,138 --> 02:36:38,765
try and pull off tomorrow...

2170
02:36:38,932 --> 02:36:39,933
it's got me scratching my head

2171
02:36:40,016 --> 02:36:41,142
about the survivability
of it all.

2172
02:36:41,309 --> 02:36:42,769
That's the thing.

2173
02:36:44,729 --> 02:36:46,648
Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?

2174
02:36:46,815 --> 02:36:47,899
Part of the journey is the end.

2175
02:36:49,901 --> 02:36:50,902
What am I even tripping for?

2176
02:36:51,069 --> 02:36:52,153
Everything is gonna work out

2177
02:36:52,237 --> 02:36:55,156
exactly the way
it's supposed to.

2178
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:00,328
I love you 3,000.

2179
02:39:15,255 --> 02:39:17,716
You know, I wish there was a way

2180
02:39:17,799 --> 02:39:19,008
that I could let her know.

2181
02:39:21,511 --> 02:39:23,638
That we won.

2182
02:39:25,014 --> 02:39:26,725
We did it.

2183
02:39:30,311 --> 02:39:32,105
She knows.

2184
02:39:36,985 --> 02:39:39,070
They both do.

2185
02:39:48,037 --> 02:39:49,122
How you doing, squirt?

2186
02:39:49,289 --> 02:39:50,290
Good.

2187
02:39:50,457 --> 02:39:51,791
You good?

2188
02:39:51,958 --> 02:39:54,669
Good. You hungry?

2189
02:39:55,086 --> 02:39:56,087
What do you want?

2190
02:39:56,796 --> 02:39:58,214
Cheeseburgers.

2191
02:40:03,011 --> 02:40:05,263
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2192
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:06,848
Okay.

2193
02:40:09,434 --> 02:40:11,686
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

2194
02:40:11,853 --> 02:40:12,854
Okay.

2195
02:40:29,621 --> 02:40:31,039
So...

2196
02:40:31,289 --> 02:40:33,458
when can we expect you back?

2197
02:40:35,043 --> 02:40:36,878
About that...

2198
02:40:37,128 --> 02:40:39,297
Thor, your people need a king.

2199
02:40:39,464 --> 02:40:41,341
No, they already have one.

2200
02:40:43,468 --> 02:40:44,469
That's funny.

2201
02:40:50,058 --> 02:40:51,893
Are you being serious?

2202
02:40:55,563 --> 02:40:57,816
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2203
02:40:58,399 --> 02:41:00,985
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2204
02:41:02,278 --> 02:41:04,030
But you, you're a leader.

2205
02:41:04,656 --> 02:41:06,366
That's who you are.

2206
02:41:08,868 --> 02:41:10,829
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2207
02:41:10,995 --> 02:41:12,497
I'm counting on it...

2208
02:41:12,664 --> 02:41:14,165
Your Majesty.

2209
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:25,510
What will you do?

2210
02:41:26,261 --> 02:41:27,679
I'm not sure.

2211
02:41:27,846 --> 02:41:29,889
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2212
02:41:29,973 --> 02:41:31,391
I have no path.

2213
02:41:31,558 --> 02:41:32,976
I do have a ride though.

2214
02:41:33,142 --> 02:41:35,103
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2215
02:41:39,607 --> 02:41:41,150
Here we are!

2216
02:41:41,609 --> 02:41:43,152
Tree, good to see you.

2217
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:51,035
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2218
02:41:51,452 --> 02:41:53,329
Where to first?

2219
02:41:54,455 --> 02:41:55,498
Hey.

2220
02:41:56,124 --> 02:41:58,084
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2221
02:41:58,251 --> 02:41:59,252
I'm in charge.

2222
02:41:59,794 --> 02:42:02,338
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2223
02:42:02,505 --> 02:42:04,048
Of course.

2224
02:42:06,676 --> 02:42:09,220
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2225
02:42:09,387 --> 02:42:10,430
It makes you think that maybe

2226
02:42:10,513 --> 02:42:11,890
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2227
02:42:12,515 --> 02:42:13,850
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2228
02:42:14,017 --> 02:42:15,018
Quail?

2229
02:42:15,184 --> 02:42:17,437
Okay? I am merely trying to
be of service and assisting.

2230
02:42:17,604 --> 02:42:18,813
Quill.

2231
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:19,856
That's what I said.

2232
02:42:20,023 --> 02:42:22,400
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2233
02:42:22,567 --> 02:42:23,943
Sounds fair.

2234
02:42:26,696 --> 02:42:29,073
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2235
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:30,241
I got some blasters,

2236
02:42:30,325 --> 02:42:31,618
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2237
02:42:31,784 --> 02:42:33,995
Yes! Please, use knives.

2238
02:42:34,162 --> 02:42:35,246
Yeah. Knives.

2239
02:42:35,413 --> 02:42:36,956
I am Groot.

2240
02:42:42,712 --> 02:42:44,088
Not necessary.

2241
02:42:44,255 --> 02:42:45,715
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2242
02:42:45,882 --> 02:42:48,885
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2243
02:42:52,472 --> 02:42:53,681
Me.

2244
02:42:54,766 --> 02:42:55,600
Right?

2245
02:42:56,517 --> 02:42:58,728
Yes, you.

2246
02:42:58,978 --> 02:43:01,397
Of course! Of course.

2247
02:43:01,564 --> 02:43:03,232
Of course.

2248
02:43:04,984 --> 02:43:06,527
Remember...

2249
02:43:07,362 --> 02:43:08,571
you have to return the stones

2250
02:43:08,655 --> 02:43:09,656
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2251
02:43:09,822 --> 02:43:10,823
or you're gonna open up

2252
02:43:10,907 --> 02:43:13,034
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2253
02:43:13,201 --> 02:43:14,202
Don't worry, Bruce.

2254
02:43:14,744 --> 02:43:16,621
Clip all the branches.

2255
02:43:17,163 --> 02:43:18,915
You know, I tried.

2256
02:43:20,208 --> 02:43:22,210
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2257
02:43:22,293 --> 02:43:24,420
I really tried
to bring her back.

2258
02:43:27,715 --> 02:43:29,342
I miss her, man.

2259
02:43:29,717 --> 02:43:30,718
Me too.

2260
02:43:34,806 --> 02:43:37,225
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2261
02:43:39,811 --> 02:43:41,270
You're a good man, Sam.

2262
02:43:41,813 --> 02:43:43,356
This one's on me, though.

2263
02:43:47,819 --> 02:43:49,737
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2264
02:43:51,572 --> 02:43:52,824
How can I?

2265
02:43:52,991 --> 02:43:54,784
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2266
02:44:02,375 --> 02:44:04,168
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2267
02:44:04,544 --> 02:44:06,045
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2268
02:44:13,428 --> 02:44:15,221
How long is this gonna take?

2269
02:44:15,471 --> 02:44:18,224
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2270
02:44:23,312 --> 02:44:24,564
You ready, Cap?

2271
02:44:24,731 --> 02:44:27,150
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2272
02:44:27,817 --> 02:44:28,943
You bet.

2273
02:44:30,445 --> 02:44:32,030
Going quantum.
Three...

2274
02:44:32,613 --> 02:44:33,448
two...

2275
02:44:34,115 --> 02:44:35,324
one.

2276
02:44:37,201 --> 02:44:39,245
And returning in five...

2277
02:44:39,412 --> 02:44:40,371
four...

2278
02:44:40,538 --> 02:44:42,373
three, two...

2279
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:43,875
one.

2280
02:44:51,132 --> 02:44:52,133
Where is he?

2281
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:54,052
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2282
02:44:54,218 --> 02:44:55,678
He should be here.

2283
02:45:01,184 --> 02:45:02,101
Get him back.

2284
02:45:02,268 --> 02:45:03,394
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2285
02:45:03,561 --> 02:45:05,438
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2286
02:45:29,420 --> 02:45:31,005
Go ahead.

2287
02:45:48,981 --> 02:45:49,732
Cap?

2288
02:45:52,068 --> 02:45:53,820
Hi, Sam.

2289
02:45:56,823 --> 02:45:59,867
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2290
02:46:01,994 --> 02:46:05,832
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2291
02:46:06,958 --> 02:46:08,292
maybe...

2292
02:46:08,793 --> 02:46:13,589
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2293
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:17,718
How'd that work out for ya?

2294
02:46:20,221 --> 02:46:21,639
It was beautiful.

2295
02:46:22,974 --> 02:46:24,684
Good. I'm happy for you.

2296
02:46:24,851 --> 02:46:25,893
Truly.

2297
02:46:26,644 --> 02:46:27,937
Thank you.

2298
02:46:29,272 --> 02:46:30,523
Only thing bumming me out...

2299
02:46:30,690 --> 02:46:32,275
is the fact
I have to live in a world

2300
02:46:32,358 --> 02:46:34,277
without Captain America.

2301
02:46:38,072 --> 02:46:40,867
That reminds me.

2302
02:46:49,375 --> 02:46:50,585
Try it on.

2303
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:17,612
How does it feel?

2304
02:47:20,198 --> 02:47:21,908
Like it's someone else's.

2305
02:47:24,952 --> 02:47:26,120
It isn't.

2306
02:47:39,467 --> 02:47:41,052
Thank you.

2307
02:47:42,762 --> 02:47:44,055
I'll do my best.

2308
02:47:49,435 --> 02:47:51,354
That's why it's yours.

2309
02:47:53,064 --> 02:47:54,440
You wanna tell me about her?

2310
02:48:01,030 --> 02:48:02,531
No.

2311
02:48:02,949 --> 02:48:05,076
No, I don't think I will.
